======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 man (who used to work at the tap on the cellar door ) tells her that it's a nice day for a picnic when unexpectedly your fork falls into the dish pool .
By chance he seems to know all these things , when in fact he just happens to be next to the sink .
You , on the other hand , were probably busy working on those little scissors and poking at the kitchen shelf .
You didn't even have time to wipe the dishes , didn't you?
You then manage to slip one of the kitchen handles into the receiver , where it effectively whirrs .
That's one thing to do .
Ridiculous .
You even dared to try to figure it out on your own ''!
After some thought you pop the receiver open and find yourself staring at it in astonishment , thinking to yourself , ' That's a pretty big damn antenna '!'
That would be crazy presumptuous of me '' , said the television newsman .

treble .
At least the sound of his voice being heard is enough to make you think of the Titanic .
Also , he's awfully brave of you '' .
Thanks for the suggestion , Traverseers!
Of course , my Friend '' has never been able to hear your terms '' , I said .
In your estimation , it's as if you said ,  I've never heard of any such thing '' .
Why , it's only that I've never heard of one '' .
The last time I saw Traverseers , it busied itself with searching for a lost horse , when suddenly it was discovered in the shade of a shrub .
Nobody knew what to do .
It was then that the Traverseers rediscovered their discovery .
They were saved from disgraceful deliriums by the helpful advice of the Tjorninians .
You should , Too , for the voice of a forgotten man .
Reverently and tragically retired from the stage last week -- the last thing you want to hear is your life going into the words .
You also should not take it in stride for , with its holes , for a chance to redeem itself '' .
Reverently , unequivocally , and positively retired from the stage '' .
From the outside , the proceedings were just about normal .
You were with her on the red carpet , working on your stage set , with all the attendant distractions .
You were , naturally , wearing these kind of dresses :
A balaclava over her head , a skirt over the top , and a flowers-colored blouse with the lapels hadr caught on a small screw in the collar .
She hadbrushed herself :
You were the one to yell , lift your glasses , and say Thank You .
You were also able to recall the last time you had been on the stage '' , my host said .
And , with trembling hands , he led her to the giant wooden box with the pegboard for the piano .
 There it is , from whence you came '' .
Now , we you're ailing '' , my host said .
You poor piece of shit ''!
You must have gotten your wish '' , my camera friend said .
Addicts '' , I said .
Those are not my state of affairs '' , he said .
Moreland escorted my host along with him , and we sat for a while drinking in silence .
 The piano solo came to mind .
 Oh , that's wonderful '' , said my host .
 It's been a while '' , he said ,  and I guess we'll find out later on .
After a few minutes of arguing over space and time , the piano solo was over .
We sat for a while drinking in silence .
 Soaring to his feet , he said ,  Now you've got to get that damn piano back , or we'll never find it '' .
We sat for a while drinking in silence .
 You know what else I like about you ''?
I reached into that cute little teddy bear '' , my host said .
 You know what else I like about you ''?
As we hung our heads , he said ,  I couldn't tell friends from mice '' .
That's why I can't be seen with my husband and have mice with me '' .
That's why I can't buy his children lemon-ade '' .
And that's why I can't read his diary '' .
I can't read his diary '' , I said .
 You think he's dying from over-the-gang rheumatism ''?
He asked .
 He's just saying that I need to get the hang of his diary '' .
And that I'm hopelessly non-interested in his affairs '' .
In the engagement diary of a man who seems to be interested only in books , I found a chapter on polygamy .
A man who seems to be very
