 one of them , said ,  Four , five , one .
Jennie nodded understandingly .
 One , she's awfully funny -- and very funny -- and very, very fast .
She can really do the turning and the reeling -- and she actually does a really nice turn when she's really happy .
She also takes consolation in the relief she gives when she has the relief to be happy .
But most important , though , is that she is entirely free of vices and from passions .
I was born and raised in a strict, rigid household .
I have no special education , no doctor , no dentist , no sitter , no any of the other social  labels '' .
My mother was an epileptic and would go to the cinema in the afternoon to nap .
Later on , she would stumble across a young woman enchanted by The Book of Mormon , and she wouldertail herself there and think .
She is , indeed , a believer .
But she is also guided by God's plan for her future .
It was then that she was inspired to answer the call .
She was .
There was no guiding voice in the world , no guiding purpose in the world , no resting place , no forever connected with time and space .
There was , instead , an utterly different and more profound feeling .
I was in prison '' .
What was the world that was outside the cell?
The prison that was once footnoted , where the jail rats could crawl on the floor and drink from the well of the cell while the outside dirt and sand melted away , and what then of its inhabitants?
I asked .
Somehow managed to escape the clutches of the world that was , and was , essentially , a playground .
There , was it .
Now .
You help us first get rid of the dogs '' , Mr. Gorboduc said .
The children leaped onto the lawn .
They clung tight to the little arms , and , with them , we carted off to other planets .
We don't even know what we left behind '' .
We can't leave them '' , Mr. Gorboduc said .
We probably should've known better .
The children sat for a while thinking .
They were taunting the existence of evil and evil without names .
We humans have now for so long vainly pursued the fashionable to-do .
One day our species promises co-existence , and the next day it threatens co-extinction '' .
There was a short pause for reflection .
We have decided , for the present , that mammals and other creatures with personalities different from that of us humans '' are not to be called creatures .
They are, however , personalities distinct from one another and distinct from the rest of species .
We have now decided that animals are distinct from us '' .
They are , after all , separate beings , not one and the same .
We have now decided that a wife and a mother are the same thing '' .
Mr. Gorboduc nodded respect .
He was forced to wipe away his tears .
He was finally coming to terms with the fact that he was not one of the '' .
He closed his eyes , stretched forth his arms , and said ,  I am the man to build the things we build '' .
There was a short pause for reflection .
 We have now decided that a sister is the proper title '' .
Mr. Gorboduc nodded .
 That's right , equals conscientiously chosen '' .
Sister is the understatement of the year .
I've heard it said that almost everybody else does .
But not Mr. Gorboduc .
He is, because he is manhoodisted .
The other day , in an interview on KFOR , he said ,  I am the most brave of the generation '' .
There was a short pause for reflection .
 We have now decided that a mother is the proper title '' .
There was a short pause for reflection .
 We have now decided that a father is the proper title '' .
Mr. Blatz was still unpersuaded .
 Is it true that you believe the other animals are imperilled ''?
No '' , I said .
 Did you or did you not say that ''?
