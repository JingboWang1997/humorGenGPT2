 , .
 I am sorry , Mr. Crombie , but you cannot drive , or you will become a drifter '' .
There was a woman in Indianapolis who was the most   delightful '' .
She was so  well-known that  all the coast towns were  waiting to hear from me about my horndog '' .
I got a call at the office of a newspaper saying I couldn't be published because I'm an  ape '' .
I thought for a second , but then I thought for a second that it was five minutes later that I was done with this man in the woods , with his dogs , with my cats , and with my parents .
I told my mother I wasn't interested in being an  ape '' , that I wasn't trying to be nice , that I was trying to live a life of dignity and abundance .
She smiled and said ,  Your grace is enough '' .
I felt my dignity growing and my uniqueness declining.
I tried to live a normal life , appearing on television and not having my cake and eat it too '' , I said .
It wasn't working , it wasn't being creative , it was becoming impossible -- like alcohol , the only safe way out of the body hell that was slumber .
It wasn't long before I started to feel like I was in love with the person I was , and that I was in control .
I couldn't keep my eyes off her , either , my legs too long dangling from her wrists , and I could't breathe on her back .
My whole being was in danger of becoming detached , as if she were a toy which was being stretched out too far .
I couldn't keep my eyes off her , either , my legs , either , or both , and I could't breathe on her back .
I tried to be constructive and constructive with Mr. Crombie , but he always seemed to get ahead of me .
Sometimes I felt like I belonged in with Mr. Crombie '' , Moreland told me .
He was a prick and a liar and he always seemed to get ahead of me .
I didn't have to work very hard to be a man of the hour '' , I said .
But I couldn't make it make it .
I felt I owed it to myself to learn and to improve on Mr. Crombie '' , I said .
 If I couldn't do my bit , what could I do?
If I couldn't walk or run , what could I do?
If I couldn't read or write , what could I write?
It all made my stomach churn , and it made it difficult for me to be silent .
I couldn't be happy , being unhappy was like sitting in on a party and you couldn't hear the music , the people , the people you were talking to .
You couldn't tell me anything , I couldn't tell my friends , my mother or my grandmother .
I couldn't be sad , too happy : being drowned out by the music and the people was like being drowned in a bath of warm Ersteine
too much of what was being said made my mouth feel pungent , and too little , especially after a night of drinking and playing with the pegboard , made me feel guilty .
I could feel the warm ocean breeze against my teeth .
It made my nails feel plumb .
It made my palms look sacred .
It made my lips and eyelids tremble .
It made my eyelids tremble a little bit , but not too much .
It made my wrists and forearms tremble a lot , and I could tell from their trembling that Mr. Crombie was tapping at one point on one of his toes .
That's why I'm not saying you should hang him'' , morel Montegoir said .
Yes , sir , I'm recommending that you do .
If you live in certain suburbs , and there are farmers on the street , or in certain magazines , or in one newspaper , you may as well be aware of General Burnside , surrounded by office buildings , a few blocks from his home , and a couple of blocks from his wife's , whose presence brought widespread derision .
The General , faced with the problem of a just and lasting peace , turned his attention to the immediate problem of carrying on his war .
He focused his attention on the immediate problem of preventing the other side from committing suicide .
The problem , he thought , would be finding another man to lead the way .
He rose , and found himself with General Burnside at his feet .
He looked down , at Montegoir , at the helpless man who was about to be shot in the back .
It was apparent that he was deeply depressed .
His despair had no end .
The General sat on a stool in front of him , splayed his legs , and said ,  I have dinner with General Burnside this evening .
And if you are curious as to
