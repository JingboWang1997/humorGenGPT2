======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 was about seven months ago , when I was alone with her and she insisted she had been a year younger .
I had a nervous breakdown .
Not that it wasn't there .
There were a lot of unhappy moments , but most of them , I don't know , deliberate disasters such as the one I just described .

I had read all the books about it , had even tried to explain how it got under the radar , but this had all been done in the belly of a beast , a mechanical phenomenon , and there was no helping hand .
It was a real treat , and she let me go through it in hergers -- the hard drive had literally emptied out .
When I brought the case back to life , Lucy was laughing , and I was glad she was laughing so hard .
Good luck to you , Lucy '' , she said .
 You should have seen the bullet ship '' .
She paused , then added ,  She always sees more than she bargained for herself .
In the end , I was happy with the way she went along with me .
She and I had both lived in the Golden State , and we went to see the Golden State Monastery every weekend .
We paid our own rent .
We tasted the water '' .
Puzzled , I told her the truth about Sam and the water had a bright pink ring around it on the bottom of the jar .
I put the jar on the table and let the water begin to color the stones .
The color matchsticks Jonathan had created .
We spent all night on the beach , waiting for the sun to find us .
 Then , from within the jar , a heat , fury and horror tore at it
a hundred-fifty degrees , turning the sand blue and fissile , until only the scaly seafloor fins were black .
His rays didn't penetrate , and he died a ghost .
At night , when the sun was thick and clear , his monastic aura was thinner and thinner .
He woke one night .
What I had seen was a true prophet , a man of God , free of all fetters , shackled to the rock by love and hatred .
He was above the circles of men , and below the confines of the laws of nature .
He was our next day's excursion into the mines .
We met the second son of Sparky , a man I had known from the city .
He was tall and handsome , and smelled of Peruvian pepper .
He looked undressing in the mirror .
I was no longer sure of my blue jeans and the red priestcker .
I rubbed my hands together .
 I shouldn't have been wearing those things , but I hadn't been sleeping .
I rubbed my hands together for a couple of weeks .
The sleep was good .
The demons were gone .
I was just fine .
The pills weren't on the table .
I was fine .
The ritual was over .
The prophets had it coming .
The present was a real god , a real being , transcending time and space .
He would be even more real than I thought .
The ritual was complete .
I let the jar rest .
After I dressed , I arranged the clothes .
In the hospital , I got a good look at the swollen area on the lower right arm .
That was where my fingers had been glued long ago .
It was shut very clearly now , and a pinkish-white line ran through it -- the key to the temple .
In the image of the image were revealed a secret place full of dark , dead , haunting , chilling power .
My left arm was crushed .
It was three o'clock before I got to the hospital .
I dressed like a normal civilian .
I got on the elevator .
I had a short speech in front of me , in which I talked about the vision , the grief and the recovery .
There was no doctor in the world .
there was only hope .
I got on the elevator again .
I looked up to find Richard and Lucy on the other side of the elevator .
They looked scared out of their mind .
They had been thinking about me before the virus penetrated their brain .
They remembered seeing the nightmare , the one before them .
They would always look on in wonder at the boy and the terrifying knowledge that they had done him a favor by telling him the truth .
I felt more whole than any human I had ever known .
Thankful I was finally getting on .
The elevator stopped , the elevator shaft bright with activity , and I climbed to my feet .
I felt more at peace .
I was all set for tomorrow .
A woman walked up and stood by .
She was dark , slicked-back , facial , dressed in blackjack .
We didn't talk much , just the idea that
