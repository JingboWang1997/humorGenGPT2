======== SAMPLE 1 ========

The sun warmed his skin , the cool rhythm of the birds sopping wet the carpet .
Charlie's eyes focused , caught a glimpse of a friend and he fled on foot , leaving Anthea with the wound .
But the smothered sound of Anthea's voice penetrated her and he heard her again and waited until the church was all burned to the ground and she was eaten alive .
Where had he gone wrong?
There was a question mark over his left eye , which had been done away with .
Yes , that was an eye .
Yes , he'd done a question mark .
But he'd asked it from the front of his skull .
He knew her accent , long iron ear , the way she paid her taxes , from her husband , the man who once beat her to death with a racket knife .
He'd beaten her to death with a racket knife because she said she was going to burst into tears .
He'd even gone to Wal-Mart and ordered a martini -- but when he brought the door he slammed it .
No , he wasn't going to cry .
He'd beaten her to a pulp with a racket knife .
Why not try another method of bringing the situation to a boil?
He'd lost .
A lot of people in Peoria couldn't understand why we wouldn't let Freddy go .
He'd insulted everybody who'd ever done him any service , from the mayor to the fire marshal to the telegraph line .
Suppose Freddy had even left his apron on the ladder somewhere?
I wonder if Freddy had even left a pair of his pants on the set?
Have you ever tried to pull a chair down at the office ''?
I wish I had .
 Freddy was up front with me one day , when he had left his apron on the desk .
I wondered if I ought to go put him on the slide .
But I hadn't gone .
I stayed up all night .
The slide was a slide called a pivot , and I picked it up every morning when I went to class .
I didn't look at it much .
I was all set .
Panel A : Freddy the Clown .
Panel B : Gunny the Clown .
Panel C : Shirley the Hunted .
Panel D : Shawn the Hunted '' .
I said ,  That's hideous '' .
Panel A was full of skeletons .
Nor was it a furnace , because the house wasn't airtight .
You could get blown up by something as simple as a void in the carpet .
Panel A wouldn't hold .
Something had to change .
The bed had to be changed .
The hair on the back of the neck had to be terribly redone .
The whip had to be tied so that the redness could no longer hang .
There was no back porch at home .
It had to be changed .
The yard had to be redone , too , and the cracks had to be made long enough to stop the spinning of old bones .
At least the way up was up-there .
Panel B wasn't up on the little redwoods yet .
They were sleeping on the soft earth , and he was looking down at him from the top of the cliff .
He was full of talk , envy and envy and he was thinking of the old horse and the fair skin and the fine horns and the hundred dollar bill .
If he did that , the house would fall on him .
He looked up to see Mrs. Roberts , smiling , held up a light bulb .
 Go ahead , make your own lamp , old man .
It'll cost a fortune .
You'll find a nice , shining , modern form on the market .
You'll want it when you get it '' .
On the light bulb's list of things to do , he remembered seeing old Mr. Monmouth , full of happy laughs and silly faces .
Mr. Monmouth was a big-bon earmarked man who thought too much about his work .
He was a big guy about his age , with a heavy gaiety .
He wore a brown tweedy-cuffed shirt resembling an alien from another planet , a real thing , and he looked quite the simpering , for he was , indeed , like a contemporary novel -- probably the Captain from Star Wars .
But his face was ugly and messy and had , he suggested , nothing approaching true maturity .
And he spoke so slowly and with so much bitterness that he stood on the tired old man's shoulders like a flagranteress .
Mr. Monmouth was fond of saying ,  There's gonna be a solution '' , but everywhere else he was condescending and bitter .
One solution would be to put Mr. Monmouth down
that was really just dropping the word '' .
 And he couldn't be so insulting to Edythe
he is a mighty popularly elected official in this country , and he
