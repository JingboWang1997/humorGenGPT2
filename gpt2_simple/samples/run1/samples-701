======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 twice and he was in a position to do so later that night when the heater was still running .
He lit the candle and when he came back he found that Lucy was still alive and that the heater was still working .
Good grief had he done that to deserve this many lives .
Did he?
Didn't he?
He got rid of the heater one night and turned his back on Theresa when she asked .
 She's awake now , isn't she?
Going to the temple tomorrow , she thought .
Not to God .
I'll get her permission .
We can stay out of the sun for the night .
But if you don't mind me telling you what , I'll leave you to it '' .
I won't .
I'm just going to wait here for her while she gets her rites '' .
So long , Theresa .
But she didn't say it .
 I'll just-- I don't mind '' .
She was straddling him and she didn't show .
Not that it didn't bother her .
Being a widow you get tired of being tired '' .
She had an easy peace of mind .
There was a certain pride in her and an easy contempt for those around her .
Although they may not know it , the Navy isn't run by hot tubs .
It's run by people who are tired of living and are looking forward to living without .
Is it a man or a woman?
For God's sake don't you wake up ''?
She felt the urge to run up and down to her room .
 She was really turned on by this man right out of high school '' .
He would , she told herself , but she felt like a fraud and wanted to keep her eyes open .
He put on her dress and went to the window .
He greeted her turning the room .
He greeted her right there , in the center of the room .
She felt like a child again and wanted to be alone .
But instead she went to the window and looked at the thin lines on the floor .
Those little white lines defined all that was wrong with her .
They were all too familiar .
They gave her a sort of poetic license by conning her imagination .
She felt like a ghost .
She felt like a lunatic .
There was a man there , all seated him , a small , pallid figure with a narrow peakedched face and very small eyes .
He was a naked old man , standing against the wall of his cottage and gazing at her with a kind of panicky eye .
He had a deadshot in him , standing beside the coach .
He was dripping with blood .
He looked down at his heavily-shuttered hair and grinned .
 I'mross ''!
He said .
 I'll spare you the trouble of picking him up .
He quickly removed his clothes and went to the thinness of his hookah frame .
His very frame , his parts , was literally hanging off his back .
He put on his shoes , and he stood like a statue before the room .
He looked pretty , and maybe a little tall , because he was obviously thinking of Alice .
But he looked like an idiot , she thought , sitting on the bench with his clothes all folded and his clothes all folded and his shoes all under his clothes .
He seemed not to care at all that he had been eaten up by some jolly bad luck or that he had slept with the right girl .
She supposed , obviously , that JohnnyDeer was trying to sell her onto him , because he had these sorts of invoices in his drawer .
 He must have got a card from the clerk or some such thing '' .
 Well '' , the old man said , delighted with her ,  let's get going , and if not , why not ask Miss Jen if she can come back later ''?
He looked at her in amazement .
 He must have got a hotel room at some later time .
But I think I'll drive Miss Jen to Kissimmee '' .
She felt his eyes on her cheek .
 Uh-huh .
And he passes by her and gives her a warm welcome , telling her how nice she was by denying herself the pleasure of knowing him .
And now she felt like a murderess .
A kind of slut , with a mouth for eating up everything she got .
And the more she talked about her at the party , the more she convinced herself that she could be any kind of a bad girl .
There was one more thing she wanted to do , and besides the fact that she and John were both vampires , she could go over to the vampire slayer named Dookiyoon .
There was one more thing she wanted to do , and besides the fact that she was single , and because her address was on the wall of her room , it was easy to understand why nobody would
