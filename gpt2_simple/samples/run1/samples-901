 and a little of the girl were both scanty and tiny , and the long skinny wicker collapsed right next to it , rolled down over it , and bounced up and down .
Then it fell apart and nobody saw it except Phil .
He was the only one of the young .
There were other girls in the class and he was the only one of them who smiled as he did his best to smile , and he took great delight in his creations .
He finished the painting about a year later , still painting , and it is one of the most beautiful works of art in the world , and he is awarded the Order of the Carthusiast .
Philip Morris goes on a two-day walk to Caracas from his apartment .
He does not go on the basis of a request for work .
He feels it is a wonderful excuse to be somewhere else .
It is not , in the grand scheme of things , that he is dissatisfied with .
In his opinion , Venezuelan society today is in a state of crisis .
The situation in Caracas has turned violent .
Cars have been ordered being pulled because of morning leave and the mail is nowhere to be found .
Cars are being picked up at ever higher bills and are being sent home which in turn drive up traffic and fuel bills further skyrocketing .
Cars are no longer allowed in the morning and are instead restricted to sitting in traffic lights and waiting for hours .
This hours restriction has had a chilling effect on her devotion to the Holy See and she has even lessed the expenses of her trips to the Holy See herself .
Philip buys a coffin from the store and assembles a lovely Indian skull ,  Sir Quint '' , from a bone bag .
An old man with a stick and a long sword , carrying a salami , was sitting before him .
He cupped his ear and shook his head at me .
 I haven't got a salami '' , he said .
 I don't even own a knife '' .
I said :  Why  there's gonna be a fuss about ''?
He shook his head and stared at him in an insolent , disdainful fashion .
I said :  Why don't you leave it at that ''?
 He's got a thousand reasons why not to leave it at home .
I'm not leaving it at home .
I'm at home '' .
 You're not '' , he said .
 Leave it at home '' .
I said .
I had better stay here or I'll mop the floors .
He grabbed a key and walked away .
I don't even own a knife .
I'm somewhere else .
I'm not a vigilante '' .
He was never about to leave the house .
He just went about his normal day .
Going about his daily business .
My co-worker was slightly mumbling , and Maggie seemed to be having none of it .
She said that after the meeting , she would get her breakfast in a minute or two , and that Maggie would soon be coming to see her manager at the grocery store .
That did it .
Maggie did not go to the store .
She said she would just wait here and wait , like Maggie did sometimes when she was not working .
After the manager came in , everybody was so grumpy that Maggie told them she would not come back until she got back from the office .
 Then they all went to the store and drank coffee and talked about money .
Maggie said she could take half a million and come back with a kiss .
Phil said he really didn't care what she said , and she was just going to wait till the last minute .
 Afterwards they all went out and stood around eating breakfast and lunch .
When the manager came down from the station he saw Maggie and Jim standing just outside the door .
She looked frightened and said that she had breakfasted with them .
 Then they all went out and sat down on the bench and talked about money .
Phil went to the foot of the stairs and shouted to the manager .
 Oh God!
You can't make that noise again '' , the manager said .
 Oh my God '' , Maggie said .
 He's crazy '' .
Phil said .
He grabbed the manager's pistol and fired at the vest .
It bounced wildly and was flying clear into the manager's head .
Maggie spun around and said :  I think you're going to have to pay the engineer a visit '' .

He turned and went into the dressing room .
There was a call from the studio , my dear friend , for lunch .
The manager straightened out , grimacing , and wiped sweat off his brow .
He sat down again , and I got a call that our numbers were called in .
