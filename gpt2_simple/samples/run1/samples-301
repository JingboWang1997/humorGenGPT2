-he who had studied under me
were suddenly aware that he had left a lasting impression .
Ah , he had an uncanny calmness and detachment from the people around him
the sense that they had been left behind
that they might never have been the same after he had done what he had done
the detachment returned .
He was no longer the one who camped out in the snow with the chiefs
he was no longer the lone wolf
his presence no longer seemed to alarm the people
even the chief ate his words breakfast
until , all at once , he was assured that his remarks had been accurate and that he would not have mentioned his name .
Ah , he insisted on recalling hers .
 No , ma'am , I haven't , ''
She said .
 I was thinking of Alexander Appiah when I spoke to him .
It might be a good idea for you '' .
Alexander nodded .
 See '' , he said , turning on his heel and walking down the trail .
He entered a small , well-stocked camp which opened toward the trail .
The wind bored a hole between his leg and the stucco , and on the inside of the hamlet's hamlets were squelchy with dust .
The air smelled warmish and foul , and upon closer investigation , it seemed to indicate campfire worship of an ancient kind , and one evening , while he was lying in the damp earth , a large animal came upon him .
She was a hairy demon with black ons , and her tail was fastening like a whip .
Little by little , during the next six months , he was exposed to almost everything that had ever got him down .
There was the unbearable odor , the taste , and growing up , the taste of stoned hammers now becoming fawns over our elders .
And , finally , the childhood fear , which had been constant and often repeated even when we were both young enough to know them , which held that all unpleasant memories could be passed down to our children , particularly if they had been inactive in their evil parent's past .
The recent experience , all the evidence of it , had given him a strange , worrisome feeling .
The pitifully long life span , the constant threat of new ones , had made it almost impossible for him to fathom any sensible solution .
In the middle of the night , after he had slept , he came to , and was surprised to see , in the form of a fat dog , a white , small , feathered animal of gigantic size and grace who flirted with , and hung his head back , and smiled through its nose .
You ugly little snakes , you Ralph Fiennes ''!
Stop screaming , she said .
 I just realized I was pregnant '' .
 Whateva't ''?
She stared at him , almost speechless .
He had almost broken the silence , but the maternal cry of her small hand ( invisible to her children ) kept him from speaking .
He had spoken again , this time , in the maternal tone , but this time with a cry of indignant defeat .
 Ralph Fiennes .
You white devil ''!
He had not only broken the silence , but had even cried out in her voice .
 I am the one that's to blame , and I'm going to get out '' .
 ( As if to reinforce his conviction that the baby was nobody's business .
He had in fact just as badly harmed his own life as Mrs. Nadine had done by refusing to see him .
Well , there was the practical .
If he succeeded , there would not be a problem for Mrs. Nadine to face with the new baby , if she chose .
As for the old one , there had been no rejection but for approval from within the marriage , which had justly , anxiously , musted itself against becoming another echo of the past .
Who knew what Mrs. Nadine would do next?
Alliances were breaking down time after time , and if they didn't work , there was no certainty about what the new marriage would entail .
For one thing , there was the risk of confusion -- Nadine had always advised against becoming embroiled in tactical alliances , and Jonathan's careful reading of the latest gossip had proved correct .
On the other hand , if he didn't strike a blow , it would be Mrs. Janice's last gasp , and if he struck a blow , it would be Mrs. Janice's last chance .
Heuttered mammon into the wind ,  I hope so '' , she said ,  but never mind!
After all , Jonathan had never claimed the baby , nor had she for some reason loved him .
This baby was his .
It was his .
And , really , really , almost his only love .
It was ridiculous -- a baby-sitter who had lived to see a parent killed , missing or otherwise left destitute .
So they settled for platonic platonic
