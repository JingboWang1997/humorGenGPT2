======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 and in the privacy of his mind he could imagine no other course .
He was no longer a danger to the city but of its people , and his soul could breathe a sigh of relief .
The day might have settled that one right way or another .
Reaching for the past , looking for the future , he had enjoyed every moment of it .
But he had chosen despair .
To him those who died before him were as good a fellow as the man currently holding .
Yet his search for knowledge and happiness had left behind him a knot of doubts .
Was there one man who stood condemned in the presence of all?
To him all the great deeds of the past were forgotten?
Was there one murderer who stood condemned in the name of science , technology , reason and duty , and still others who thirsted for knowledge and were contented only by that knowledge?
Perhaps none of them existed .
Others , still remaining , lounged on tallow listening or watched the sun shine handsomely upon the stones .
Some of them waited for me at the foot of the cliff
myself included , waiting for them .
I trudged along with the others , afraid of the dark .
My soul hoped .
It knew no bounds .
Only shadows my father left behind me
those of my mother , for I had never known them .
Even the sand around my aunt's house was different from the kindled by the sun beneath her .
It was dark -- because I had polio '' -- but not too dark that I wondered she would have suspected it , and it was always apparent why I had polio .
She just didn't know .
Everyone except Chris , of course , who pointed out dull uniformity in texture and shape .
You have to be careful around here '' , he said , facing at me .
 I'm a professional , Chris .
This is where you learn to mix things '' .
He stopped at the stick farm sign and dropped into his old militia fashion .
 Don't worry , I know you won't question my loyalty to the United States .
I have everything we need '' .
I was sure he would , and yet I was certain he would not , because he knew what he would do .
Alliance with Sarpsis was the best thing for a couple of reasons .
First , it was contrary to theme .
We are strangers to noble bloodslinging , so why would we put our trust in one who had done nothing but what was right?
Second , and more intriguing , Richard's aversion to talking came from the time he was a small child .
When he was little , we did not talk much to each other .
He did not understand the ancient faiths nor the customs of the new immigrants .
We did not enjoy eye-contact , but he never turned his back on us .
He did not look at us , and we did not question his religious convictions .
His only activity was playing with dolls and playing with frogs .
While he was at it he had developed a close and loving relationship with the frog-player , and was able to keep him company by encouraging him to participate in battle .
We used to hold his combat sports in higher regard , by the respect he had for our soldiers .
Maggie and I used to play hopscotch with Mike's hands ( Phantom Tactics , p. 141 ) .
He had picked up on this activity a long time ago and tried to emulate it , but the dolls were too big to be played with .
He had even encountered a man , named Jack , who dressed like a soldier and took his mane and the badges of his companies like a real man and took his hides and his trophies like a real man .
Well , Mike had won the trust of all of us and we had a moral responsibility to him .
We sat back comfortably at our computers , happy to be alive , and discussed the big decision , the one that big .
It was a moral victory for all of us .
All of us -- Chris , Bobbie and everybody in between -- were spared the harsh reality of war and were spared the cynicism and the scorn that greeted it .
We said ,  Thanks '' , but the moral highball wasn't going to change the fact that we had done our part .
It wasn't even our responsibility to decide the future , but the readers' imagination , ours and of course the book's near-universal positive response are our few positive moments .
In any case , we were told , we were adults and could decide anything .
 What did that leave us to do ''?
We were told that Chris had written down the words on his napkins , and we were appalled .
It read , In the future ''?
We thought , pointless and desperate of trying to remember anything of the past .
It was as if the past had somehow been erased from our consciousness , and therefore it was impossible to think about the future .
