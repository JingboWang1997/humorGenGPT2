 this were in the bag. Now they had a reason to think that the sunburn and swelling would ease the sting very quickly .
What did he want with a bride , a man who did not hesitate in saying that , if it became necessary to have a child , a divorce lawyer should be named ''?
Mr. Lee looked like he might take a stab at saying a prayer , but it was evident that his eyes focused on the doorframe and wondered what the lawyer would do .
That morning the lawyer showed him a picture of Gertrude Ann , and he seemed to think that she should be dressed as if she were some kind of grotesque caricature , and with that he left the room and went downstairs to his dressing-room .
Gertrude Ann's bedspread was pale and curled up against the wall , and the carpet was streaked with bloodstains .
The lawyer and Miss Ann had come up from their hotel room in the morning with a white cloth parasol over her head , and the lawyer placed it on the bed .
She wore it out of hand , and after a moment's hesitation the parasol came down again and sank back over her head .
When she tried to stand , the lawyer sat down , and the bloodshot images flashed in her eyes .
She was pale and wet from the sunburn , but she was not sick at all .
She just stared at the parasol for a while , then put in a breath she had never taken and stood up .
She felt better and went to her own bedroom .
She had not slept for days .
Her pale face and the blotched blood from the old white cloth seemed too much to bear .
The parasol finally came down and she could not keep from blinking at it .
She went to her closet and turned on the dry floor .
She drew back before opening the drawer and finding a lump in her throat .
Her face seemed swollen with fever because the blood was still drawn back and forth between the new white cloth and the old one .
Her eyes were dilated and her face seemed to dilate with water because the veins drained out .
Her mouth was rigid and her eyes were rigid because she was still trying to remember the old black cloth .
After a moment's hesitation , the lawyer opened the drawer and found a lump in her throat .
She could not eat , she felt nauseous , and she looked pale and dry .
It took her about two or three more hours before she could look at the old white cloth again .
She couldn't remember eating at all except as a last resort .
Dr. Bannister suggested that she stay with Mr. Lee until she could eat some rest because of the swelling in her neck .
She said she would only be sick for a couple of days , then her swollen stomach began to beat .
She said that if she went back to sleep feeling better she would go back to bed in the morning and feel better until the next day .
That's one of the remedies I have tried and it doesn't make any difference at all to what position I am in and what the next position is .
Just wait and see '' .
Dr. Bannister was silent in the bedroom .
He could not see the lump in her stomach or the infection in the blood .
It was still coming back in and on and on .
She was trembling in the bed .
The lawyer felt a small prick against his arm .
He placed the chart in the pillbox , pushed it against the dampness , and tried to feel it .
He was flat on his back and conscious , as if in a game of jigsaw puzzles , of shifting the pieces as possible .
Now he could feel the knot in the flesh , the pulse racing through him .
The pleasure in hearing the lawyer say that he could move in a certain straight line or a certain certain certain certain certain certain certain certain all these was not going to please the prick in him .
He wanted it , and he felt this strange pleasure in being able to say that .
He could move in front of the mirror , against the background of the vivid colors of the city .
The pleasure in being able to say that felt almost spiritual .
He felt an urge to move , like a motion-sensing machine that picked up signals and carried them down corridors .
He felt someone moving in his gut but he could not feel it .
He felt an urge to move , like the humming of a bird at dusk and its voice so close to it that he could feel its neck arching and hiss like a whip in his hand .
 It doesn't feel like a whip in your hand '' , he thought as he looked at the image of the whip in the image of the image of the image of the image of the image of the , not the the the the the , the the , the , the the the the the , his voice rapping against the darkness until he stopped it , until
