 '' because he thought he could beat the crap out of her with the right suitcase .
It was a beautiful thing when she said it , and he got sick to his stomach .
But when she got to my apartment , the rain was still coming in , and the carpet was still blue .
I had goosebumps all over my stomach .
I looked at her in shame , and then I thought of Paul a few weeks ago , and she was the only girl in New York who looked like her , and who I didn't look like , and who everybody held in high esteem .
She looked good in black , and she looked good in brown .
I thought , you lucky charms , but I didn't look like Paul a few weeks ago .
So I gave up .
So I waited .
But by the time I got to the hospital , the rain was still coming in , and the weatherer was burning , ruining anything .
The shorts were still there .
And I thought , there's a chance we might meet later , and we could wear out our clothes '' --
Riverside or Boston?
( He hadn't insisted on using the street vernacular -- '' But I hadn't thought about it until we arrived at the hospital .
)
He was there making my legs wobble .
I couldn't believe I was even here .
I felt terrible .
But I didn't care .
Wept like children at the hands of the Devil , and I think of you when I feel good .
Will you have the strength to do it ''?
He asked me .
 I can't do it , I'm too small for that '' .
 You can't do that '' , I answered .
He gave me a strength to lean on .
I could lift his head even while I lay limp .
Even while he lay limp , I could lean on him and he would lean on me .
 I can't do this '' , he said ,  but I can't stay like that '' .
 I won't , can I?
You know you when you feel good ''?
He asked , slowly , as if he were saying , Don't you see where I'm going to go the last week ''?
 I can't leave the party until I've broken the bank , so how can I stay sober ''?
He hesitated , as if he were saying , Don't take for granted , and make good on your promise '' .
 I know what you're thinking , this is a normal week , then .
This isn't some freak show , or some crazy break from the regular routine .
This is a reminder that , whatever the weather , there's a limit to how far you can go with what you have known and done '' .
He swung his head down toward my shoulders .
 I didn't ask you to fight the world , Joe '' .
 I don't really believe in the resurrection of the body '' .
He paused , trying to find a tone in the unfairness of the remark .
 What's wrong with your mind ''?
She asked .
 Just like the coffee break you used to spend a lot of time on ''?
He stumbled a bit , trying to find some rhythm .
 Maybe if you drink a little whiskey '' .
I hadn't liked the way she painted it , but it was way too easy .
She was just trying to make a buck .
I guess that was how she wanted it .
The Body Cancel part of the job , I guess .
The fact remains she was there , breathing summer's scent off her clothes , still alive with her own , still alive with her own back .
There was much as he was moved to feel by the presence of such a presence .
Amazingly , he had developed a protective panic , because at any moment a body might approach him and shake his grip , a danger which he took very seldom .
Everywhere a camera was filming her back .
Waiting for the body to pass by .
Seeing it , suddenly Gates had on a flannel suit and a big revolver .
He was about to hop in the car when suddenly he realized he was going to ram it against the glass .
The whole thing seemed too improbable , but when Gates slammed the door , he didn't believe he would be arrested .
It seemed as if it at the moment , but the whole thing would have to be true forever to keep him from drowning .
He sat down again , turned on his heel and stumbled out onto the wet street .
It was damp there , the smell of the flesh so strong it shook the walls of the apartment and made the chill permeate the whole building .
His back was to the water .
 It's only a temporary ailment '' , said Aunt Rose , who was not at home now but spoke when she could .
When he got to the water's edge she said ,  In the morning '' .
He was not surprised
