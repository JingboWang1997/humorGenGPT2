 idea? Well -- that's the difficulty here , doesn't it?"
She laughed .
Adele grinned .
She said ,  I wish I was old enough to remember when sex was fun .
Especially when it's so damn hard .
I wish I were older than this myself '' .
Her eyes went back to touch , where they had always stayed cold and remote .
 Well -- you've changed since you were a baby , haven't you ''?
I said .
 You've changed a lot .
You won't call me Shirley , but I assume you were younger than that '' .
 Shirley , do you think I'm old enough to remember that ''?
 Not yet .
Maybe next time , when you're all set ''?
I grinned .
I had that feeling of having been an incarnation of Shirley the Brave Woman ever since I was a baby .
It was a good feeling , wasn't it?
Moreover , if I wasn't already , I figure , how does one live now?
Even if I wasn't even yet an incarnation of Shirley the Brave Woman , how can one live?
Even if death came one day and one thousand lives were at stake , would we be standing as one?
Even if death came one day and fifteen thousand lives were at stake , would we be standing as one?
Even if we stood together as one , would that make us a couple now , Anne and George?
At least we'll be together in law school '' , she said firmly .
 I think that married couple looks really neat '' .
They stood in silence , then added .
 I've got one wish , Mr. Robards , if we go this way , we have to give up our guns and armor .
We have these little revolvers in our cars .
We carry them everywhere .
They give us so much comfort .
We don't have to carry all the things .
We don't have the huge machines and deadly paraphernalia .
We can sit back and let the great expansiveness of the family fortune provide .
We'll all be fine '' .
Anne nodded .
Inertia shot up in her chest .
 To your great advantage '' , she said , and pointed at the little black sights .
 All mounted .
Added to that was the telescoped hammer .
Now she could use her cane a bit .
And I could use the light .
She was sitting all alone in the low chair .
Her arms bristling with cordials , her legs tense with strain .
 What are you doing ''?
Going into the morning hours , she said simply ,  I have this important task for the Board .
I am going to lunch with Mr. Cromwell today .
I must tell you first , that I am entirely satisfied with the way the way I am doing it .
I will not order a house party for my daughter '' .
Anne stared at the blank forms on the table .
They had vanished .
Instead , they had been replaced by a smiling acceptance from the table .
 Have you tried to visit our Monticello home yet ''?
 No '' .
She frowned .
This was something she had to learn in her own home -- there was a reason children learned by themselves .
Can't you take a look ''?
She frowned .
 I have no doubt that your daughter will benefit from a home visit one way or the other .
We know that the children of Monticello parents murder their parents once and that once that happens , the child is left with Monticello .
Yet the child never got to the parent who murdered them .
No action of the child's father has ever altered this fact .
No action of the child's mother has altered this circumstance .
It is my opinion that any action taken by you or Mr. Cromwell would entail great bodily and mental strain .
My advice is that you do not travel to New York .
You do not visit our home for a few days , and on the contrary , you visit '' .
 Ah '' .
But there was something in the square of her eyes .
She was afraid to say it , but she knew she would be scrutinized all evening .
Feeling uncomfortable , she went to the little English girl in the corner .
 Well , I'll get word to you '' , the girl said .
 You know '' , she said , and quickly , almost deliberately , she reached over and touched her ankle .
It wasn't her sock but her ankle -- she knew how to place it .
 Oh , my '' , the little girl said , and sat down .
At last , the uncomfortable silence was broken .
The meeting of minds lasted about as fast as a speeding bullet had a heartbeat , and Anne felt as strong as a log , and she felt better .
The Board of Education held its next meeting .
All members were present .
The chair was full of admirers
