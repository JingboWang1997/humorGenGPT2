======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 then, that it's very important to recognize that in the New Deal era, which was very much based on the idea that we're talking about here, the word "prescribed" in the statute of limitations refers back to the period before the act of Congress; and so, that is not the same thing as "prescribed," which has been interpreted as the term "prescribed by," or a common term of all-purpose legislative use. This case should be considered on the basis of whether it is a prescription or not. It is an interpretation of the statutory structure, of the statute of limitations. The Court finds that, under the Court's precedent of other Federal cases, there is no requirement that a statute of limitations be in the statute of limitations, which is the "prescribed" --
 Well, suppose the Court were to affirm or reverse your decision in this case? Would you say the Court or some judge would then have authority to reverse your decision?
 The --

 No, no. If you get that far, he wouldn't, as we've been arguing, because he would still have the case in front of him. I don't think you'll see that point.
 I'm --
 All right. Now, what if the Court did affirm this decision? Would you then be able to retroactively rewrite the statute of limitations? I presume, of course, that the answer to that hypothetical would be yes, but, for whatever reason, the Government, if they prevail, would have a lot of other work to do. Would they then be able to rewrite the statute of limitations? I presume, of course, that the answer to that, as well, would be no. But would the Government be able to rewrite the statute of limitations, to retroactively rewrite the statute of limitations, in order to retroactively rewrite the statute of limitations?
 Well, I would think that the Government may be able to accomplish that, for a number of reasons, but, for the reasons that you've stated, I'd say yes.
 What do you think, at the end of the case, of the argument that you've been making, that -- that they could not have retroactively rewritten the statute of limitations under your holding?
 Well, that's correct, Your Honor.
 If you're right on that, then, in effect, the only question at the end is, Does the statute of limitations apply to the cases that did not result in convictions, or not?
 No. That's correct. That was absolutely correct.
 No, but that's what the trial judge in this case thought, was correct, wasn't it, Your Honor?
 Well, but --
 Now, isn't that the case as well?
 No, No, Your Honor. I think if what was really involved, for purposes of purposes of this case, was determining the "prescribed" period under the NDA, which is one of the purposes of the Act of Congress, and to determine whether there was, in fact, the, quote, "prescribed," the "prescribed by," or the "prescribed by," in the case of the Brady case, doesn't have to run on a statute of limitations, then to determine whether there was a sentence, then there's no statutory text that allows that kind of language; but it is clear from the phrase, "to determine whether there was a sentence," that the "prescribed," which this Court has applied in Brady cases, was really -- -- was really a way to distinguish the Brady case from the "notwithstanding" case, Justice Stevens, which is a case under the Brady Act.
 What did the State make, Your Honor?
 Well, the State made --
 It's -- it's not a very clear case, aren't they?
 I wouldn't go so far as to call it an "evening school statute," Your Honor. I think that, even in the Brady case, there were some references to "evening school statute" -- or, quote, "evening school statutes," that are a little more precise, that, in "prescribed," is the one form of the word, "prescribed by," that, at least in our view --
 But this --
 -- that --
 -- this would be the statute of limitations.
 -- this Court has consistently construed this --
 Yes.
 -- statute of limitations to include "prescribed," in my view, doesn't that agree with your position?
 Well, it would --
 Is that the case, at the end of the day?
 You may be right. That's correct. And that "prescribed" --
 Well, I thought that was, in fact, the case in the Court of Appeals, and I think, too, Your Honor.
 That's correct.
 So why isn't that the case here? Why isn't that the most precise way of saying it?
 Well, I think, for example, in an "evening school
