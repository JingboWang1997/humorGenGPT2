 in in the case, I think, for that type of action, would be a reasonable one under those standards for a constitutional violation.
 Do you agree with that, Justice Stevens?
 Absolutely not, Justice Kennedy.
 The Second Circuit in this case thought it was.
 Yes -- that's right. And the First Circuit -- there is a First Circuit precedent for double jeopardy, which is that double jeopardy is the ultimate test and not the alternative. In the Batson case --
 It never comes up. It never comes up.
 And the Sixth Circuit held in this case, it could do what it does -- it can come up. It can come up because of the double jeopardy standard. And I think what's important about this statute is the fact that, because it was not before, the Second Circuit did not decide the merits at that point and still is not considering the merits of this motion in this case. If either of the two circuits had decided the merits of the motion in this case, the Eighth Circuit would have done it first. And that means it's not before the Court and it can't be decided before it.
 If either circuit ruled in our favor, there is a motion for certiorari pending. If either circuit or the Sixth Circuit had done this, the motion for certiorari would be pending.
 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The case is submitted.
 We'll hear argument in the first post-conviction proceeding in the Eighth Circuit. Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Kneedler, the Eleventh Circuit found that he made ineffective assistance of counsel. We have the opinion of the Court of Appeals: The Sixth Circuit found that he made ineffective assistance of counsel in the Eleventh Circuit in this case in which he testified in his third appeal. We have a reply brief due in the first post-conviction proceeding, which is also pending at this time. We would ask the Court to remit this case to the Eleventh Circuit for further proceedings under the Sixth Circuit and to hold these findings on review. The claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was denied in the Eleventh Circuit and the judgment is affirmed. The Sixth Circuit, unlike the Eleventh Circuit, held -- held that Mr. Kneedler failed to prove ineffective assistance of counsel in this case by a preponderance of the evidence. They did not address whether or not he had been competent in his capacity as an attorney, his capacity to understand the claims of the State in which he was representing himself. We would respectfully submit that the Sixth Circuit was wrong in holding ineffective assistance of counsel, and therefore, to this Court we ask it to remit this case to this Court for further proceedings under Sixth Circuit.
 Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Goldstein. Mr. Goldstein, the Eleventh Circuit reversed the Eleventh Circuit's judgment of harmless error. It found that a motion was not entertained, and therefore in the Eighth Circuit he would have -- he was still an incompetent person. He was entitled to a writ of certiorari and he could have applied for certification. He was entitled to his Sixth Amendment right to have counsel at the time he filed his petition. He was entitled to a new appeal. What the Eleventh Circuit did in this case is, as I understand it, was to hold it would be an appeal based on invalidity in light of that Court's ruling and the Sixth Circuit's ruling. Now, what a writ of certiorari would be. It would mean an appeal based on a different merits determination of the Sixth Circuit, because that Sixth Circuit's opinion was itself on merits. It would be an appeal based on a different merits determination of this Court, rather than a new merits determination, and therefore that would not be an appeal. What the Eleventh Circuit did in this case were hold 2nd and 4th Circuit cases should be reheard. Those cases were all held to be erroneous. Here, we have a new merits determination of the Eleventh Circuit itself. The Eleventh Circuit's opinion said, look, the Sixth Circuit erred. It erred on merit, on the right of the defendant to make a new claim and was wrong on the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel by holding that that issue of ineffective assistance could be -- what you say would be subject to the remand of the Sixth Circuit, and therefore it should have been remanded. It held that there was a remand of the Eleventh Circuit. It said, you -- you have asked this Court to remand this case to this Court. The Sixth Circuit was wrong there was a remand. The Eleventh Circuit erred in holding that the Sixth Circuit's opinion was inconsistent with the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit. So, we have a new merits determinations of this Court, and the new merits determinations are erroneous. What the Eleventh Circuit said in this area, this Court's judgment, which is this Court's judgment, is that because of this court's judgment that a motion for another post-conviction
