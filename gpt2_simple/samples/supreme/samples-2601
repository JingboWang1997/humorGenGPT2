======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 says, well, he's going to make it clear that he's not going to make a finding that it was not based on race. He certainly is going to do that in writing for the record in response to my earlier challenges. I've already been --
 You won't. I mean, if I were making that claim then I wouldn't -- I wouldn't call it a claim.
 Well -- well, I'm -- I don't think I am making that claim here. I -- I think I think that the point of the -- the argument was that there's a claim made, which is to allow Mr. Avery to tell his side of the story. In the alternative, the -- the Government could have said -- say, excuse me, the Government could have --
 But -- but your argument just makes a more sweeping objection. It -- it says that if the statement were made through the use of a racial slur, it would be perfectly okay. You'd say that's not a racial slur. I mean, you are saying that a statement could be made simply by saying it was a racial slur.
 Well, we're --
 That would be sufficient. It doesn't matter what he said, just saying it is a race slur.
 Well, to the extent that it's a race statement, I don't know what he would be saying if he were using a racial slur in -- in responding to the -- the -- of a suggestion that he might not have made.
 Well -- well, the -- the difference is, is -- it's not just some racial slur. It's a statement of the position he's taking in making the plea. And -- and the Government's burden is to show that the claim was premised on racism.
 Justice Breyer, I -- I think the point is not whether his claim is premised on racism, the point is where we are dealing with this defendant's claim with the statement, which was made in effect under a threat that he would not make a defense.
 Well, that's precisely the question that's addressed by our case. We don't -- we haven't asked it here. I mean, Justice -- Justice Breyer, I've asked it before. There's no constitutional obligation for the Government to make an appeal of race by its own admission.
 But that wouldn't be our burden if we're -- if we were making the affirmative defense in the way the Court does -- in the way the Court is suggesting that a defense rests. We're not asking whether it rested in his favor. We're saying even if it was known to him that he was being asked to make an -- to do it in -- in effect in a threat, in effect in a threat to -- because he was under significant stress, in effect threatened with immediate expulsion if he -- if he didn't make the appeal under these circumstances, the Government would have a right to challenge the credibility of his identity because that's the same thing that this Government was saying when the statute says that the Government shall release an ex-felon, that that the Government shall not release him unless it was proved --
 Justice Ginsburg, you don't say, nor do I, that the -- the defendant has to prove that he wasn't the person he said he was. That's not relevant. What you seem to be doing is saying is, look, if -- if Justice Ginsburg believes that's sufficient proof, so be it. I mean, she's not saying it has to be clear, and I'll leave you with whatever is sufficiently clear that she found not clear, whether that's a threat or not, whether it's a racial epithet or an attempt to intimidate. But if you're going to prove it through the use of a race slur in connection with the plea agreement that he won't be making the defenses required by law, so be it.
 I -- I agree with that portion of Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical questions. But you need to understand the position that Justice Kennedy is taking, the implicit position of the Government's position. And the Government argues that by the nature of that statement, if -- if the -- if -- even if the Government knows that there is an -- knowing that there is evidence that is -- that -- that the defendant has acted with purpose -- and let me take a -- a hypothetical example in which the Government knows that that -- that the person that he is making the plea agreement with has been committing some kind of a crime and knows that those crimes have been going on for a while, and he's saying this is just like being the victim of a crime. He has no reason to believe that this is the same person that did it. He knows that this is not the same person. He knows that it's not an individual, that this is a group, that it doesn't have to be any more credible than any other group. He knows that this person is going to be a -- is going to be a trigger for the Government. That's why they are pleading this as a
