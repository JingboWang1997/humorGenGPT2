======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 it's hard to find a case that has been quite as -- to find a case to find an answer.
 We found a case, Justice Scalia, I think, in the Conelli case. In Conelli, the Court held that there is a difference between the State and the Federal court decision. And in Conelli, as the parties noted, the dissent, in contrast to the Court, held that a court is subject to review only where the question is the same question.
 Can you explain to me why it is that a federal district court --
 First of all, the Federal district court decision here, Conelli, is the one -- the decision in which an Eighth Circuit court is asked to adjudicate, let's say, a federal case in which the federal question is whether or -- and it's clear that when the federal court is reviewing the question --
 Well, the State -- the State court decision here, yes. And in that case, we can't imagine -- I mean, on this very -- I mean, it does say the State will determine the constitutional issue, but the fact that they are reviewing the question, which has been raised by the Ninth Circuit, it doesn't matter whether the State court or the Federal court. And that means, of course, they're going to be saying the Federal constitutional question is -- is addressed by the Eleventh Circuit and the State court.
 It's -- it's a -- the -- that's a very different case than the State court. That might take a while. The State court decision here, I -- the Ninth Circuit had said that the State court determination here is to decide a question that is a state question and not a federal question. Here, we've heard from the other side that the question, as the Eleventh Circuit held, is a Federal one that's relevant to the determination of the State court as a matter of federal law. What we're saying here is, well, this one has -- it hasn't been decided, but we're saying you're right. Here it's a Federal question of whether it's a Federal issue and not a state, and the district court is bound to decide on that question.
 It can be argued that the Eleventh Circuit -- because they're bound to that question.
 That can be argued. There are questions raised by the Eleventh Circuit which are relevant to this question. But the question here is a Federal question. It's not a national question. It's a state question. The argument could -- the argument could be made that this was a case in which there was some state question that they were going to discuss, but in fact it's a federal question of the federal courts deciding the State court determination, which does make a difference.
 I don't understand. The question in this case is if we disagree with the Eleventh Circuit on the Federal question. We have a question of the meaning of the -- the language of the language where the Federal question was to decide the Federal question. We are opposed on Federal question. And I don't understand why any -- no one can say that the Federal question is, "this," but that is the question before this Court. If we disagree with the Eleventh Circuit in a Federal question, we are opposed on Federal question, and we are subject --
 I'm sorry.
 -- to a Federal question question.
 No. The whole question of whether Federal matters are -- are a court question or a State question depends on the question that the Eleventh Circuit was faced with.
 But the question here is the question of whether the federal question is a federal question, as a federal question, as in a State --
 So you are saying the whole question of the Eleventh Circuit is not to determine if the Federal question is a question of federal law, but to decide what federal question is applicable to the Eleventh Circuit, as well?
 That's correct. The Eleventh Circuit's position is, in a Federal case, if you disagree with the Eleventh Circuit on what federal question the Eleventh Circuit is trying to decide, you win on Federal question, as well. And that's --
 But -- but the state of the issue does -- do you not have any trouble with Federal question?
 No.
 No.
 I mean, I'm -- I'm -- I've -- I mean, I can take Federal question.
 There are lots of federal questions.
 Well, just one. And that is, how do you choose between Federal law and State law. On the Federal question, in a Federal case, if somebody disagrees with the Eleventh Circuit on federal question, they won't. On the State question, as the Eleventh Circuit noted, the Eleventh Circuit's -- you won't be dealing with Federal matters, but the Eleventh Circuit doesn't have this issue. In a State case, it has a -- a State question, a Federal question, but the Eleventh Circuit doesn't have this issue. That's why the Federal question that was
