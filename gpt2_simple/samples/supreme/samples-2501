======== SAMPLE 1 ========
rupt States Act of 1988, the same statute which this Court has said applies to the possession of an obscene material or a machine gun, said all you had to do in order to be a felon in that statute is to possess an obscene material that was intended for a person to use in violating the State law. So that was the definition of the crime of possessing an obscene material. And then in the third category is an aggravated felony. And in these cases, if you have a conviction under either one, you're going to be subject to a mandatory sentencing scheme that is designed to discourage and deter the serious offense of possessing an obscene material or a machine gun. And then you'd have to go on to go back to the classification --
 But then, as I understand the -- you know, these are classified crimes, not just possession. They are aggravated felonies.
 They're definitely not under the Controlled Substances Act, but under the Sentencing Reform Act -- we don't take position on whether the Controlled Substances Act is an adequate means to describe these kinds of crimes under the Sentencing Reform Act. But the -- the concept of an aggravated felony can be very broad. It can cover -- to be clear, the word aggravated carries over from one class of crimes, murder, to another class of crimes, theft and aggravated assault. So if somebody had somebody convicted under murder and aggravated murder in the Sentencing Reform Act and then convicted a second and successive crime under the Controlled Substances Act, they'd be in serious danger under the Sentencing Reform Act, which deals with that very problem. But -- but there are going to be very significant consequences to somebody not only convicted under either one of those crimes, but, even more so than that, somebody convicted under the Sentencing Reform Act and on both of those crimes in the first case and sentence consecutively, and then on the third, you're going to be subject to a mandatory guidelines type pattern decision -- you can have that decision whether you're convicted of one or two or 15 -- for that matter. And so you can have sentencing decisions that are not based on anything except what's a person's background, what happens in the neighborhood, what's a person's upbringing. What happens when the sentencing policy is not based on those considerations --
 Well, what's the --
 What's the -- where do you get that argument, a point I don't understand where you make it; it seems to me this is a separate -- a separate problem.
 Well, Justice Kennedy, I think I was trying to respond to that with an answer that has to do in part with the fact --
 All right. Then tell me that, why do you assume this?
 Yes, Justice Kennedy.
 They don't, but they do, if you don't.
 That's why.
 Because you don't understand the concept of an aggravated felony under the statute which is --
 And I'd like to know what's -- what's your answer that you don't understand the concept of an aggravated felony in the Constitution?
 Absolutely. There's two reasons for that for no doubt. The first is that the statute talks about "aggravated felony," or "aggravated felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act." So if you're not referring to any of these statutes as the basis for us interpreting the law in the way that you just described, you're referring as well to the definition of aggravated felony under the Sentencing Reform Act. And there's another reason I don't understand. It says "aggravated felony." It doesn't say "any felony." That's what "aggravated felony" referred to. So, if "aggravated felony" refers back to the Sentencing Reform Act -- so as to the statute that's in the Sentencing Reform Act -- then we're talking, in effect, about the Sentencing Reform Act, a very general definition of aggravated felony. And I think it's important to recognize that this Court has said that an aggravated felony is defined by the Sentencing Reform Act as, "any felony that carries with it a maximum penalty of more than 15 years." I don't think that "any felony" is a relevant test case in any circumstance. And the term "aggravated felony," which itself has the connotation of "corruptly," can also be seen to have that connotation. And "corruptly" is relevant to this statute because it is the language of the statute, it is the language that relates directly to the applicability of the Sentencing Reform Act, and it is where the Government is attempting to use that language in order to give a broad reading of the applicability of that provision in a specific set of circumstances. It's not a relevant test case, not under all relevant circumstances. And I don't think that this is such a case.
 May I ask this question. Supposing he had been convicted of a lesser-included offense, and yet convicted of an aggravated felony, what he had to do to get
