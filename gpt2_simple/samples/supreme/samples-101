======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 is that the reasonableness of a trial that will involve the use of a defendant -- will allow the defendant to be represented, and then the judge can do a better job with the jury, or a trial can come about on a different basis -- the judge, that's it. Just to make that clear to you, it really doesn't matter where that time is.
 Thank you, Counsel.
 And that concludes the discussion. Thank you.
 Thank you, Mr. Justice. Mr. Garbaro.
 We'll hear argument now in Mr. Eakin's brief.
 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
 Today we are asked to respond to the petition of Mr. Eakin -- and that may be the best possible way to explain this Court's refusal to intervene -- and Mr. Eakin's brief. Mr. Eakin is a very well-respected lawyer, and by doing so, he has already created a very valuable precedent that, one, applies to all the cases in which the use of a defense of attorney is not an acceptable basis for a trial; and two, that applies to the use of an attorney at all. Now, those are reasons, in my opinion, that the Court should have thought of, in this case because that precedent may be what the majority says. That's the proper rule, and that's the right rule -- and that's what will work for this Court.
 You know, my understanding of what happened is, when you get down in the bar, there is no rule that says that the bar's opinion on a case or on a case-by-case basis is that there should be some kind of adversarial process or adversarial process here, and then if that would work, there are no problems. But as soon as you get in the bench? Even though there may be other considerations that go into that, it seems to me that the court's decision to intervene here was on purpose. They may have wanted to say, "We think it's a good -- that it's a good argument that -- I think it's a -- a -- a good thing to make in this case."
 Justice O'Connor, Mr. J. Solicitor.
 Thank you, Mr. Justice. In this case, there were three objections:
 1) We were asked to intervene, because Mr. Johnson was asking for it.
 2) We submitted to the Court a brief that had been submitted by the parties -- we -- we submitted a brief submitted by the parties -- that had been submitted by the Court or had been prepared by counsel -- and even that brief had been withdrawn, and that brief was never entered here, and the Court never considered the -- they did not consider that argument in the case.
 You did it first -- and -- and we want to -- or, in our view, they could have done it even on the first day.
 Justice O'Connor, Mr. Solicitor.
 Thank you, Mr. Eakin. The Court is aware of these concerns, at least as to the question of this Court being engaged by counsel. I agree we wanted to get this Court involved by the earliest --
 Mr. Eakin is now an Associate or Associate. But you submitted a brief, did -- said, and we are seeking relief from that brief -- to the Court because you wanted to intervene, and they wanted to see it in your brief first before they did it. I -- I'm -- I don't think that's the proper answer to this -- or the proper -- to answer your question, Justice Breyer. It's -- it's -- it's important to note, but in fact, I think, you had been asked.
 Well, I think, Justice Breyer, that, indeed, that was -- of course, that -- I -- I think that is not necessarily a good argument. It's certainly not an argument that should go in the record, and should be used to advance relief in this case.
 Your Honor, it is not a standard which the District Court had given as its own --
 I mean --
 --
 -- argument that this was an appropriate response to the petition.
 Your Honor, I don't -- I didn't -- I didn't believe it at first, and I didn't think that we had an adequate reply. I was -- I mean, I --
 Your Honor, the Court -- it -- may I -- I think -- I agree, there may be good arguments on both sides, but that is not the evidence we presented in this case. I think -- I don't think that it is sufficient, and it is not enough that the Court thought this case should have been raised in advance. You don't -- I mean, I take your theory about the -- the evidence from the time, but that -- that -- in particular, I do not believe it is enough for the Court to have thought --
 Thank you, and I have -- I have a --
