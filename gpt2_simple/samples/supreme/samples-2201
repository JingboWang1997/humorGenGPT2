======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 reckless conduct. This would not be a -- this would not be consistent with the nature of this. I mean, this is -- this is not a situation where the defendant was acting in self-defense, and that's what the question is. You can get away with a misdemeanor crime and a simple assault if you were acting in self-defense and there was no serious injury to the other person. If the other -- or what this Court found is that the defendant acted in self-defense in this case and that had absolutely no effect on his conduct, all that the defendant did was ask for the -- the victim to stop hitting him with a stick because he said, "You're hitting me with the stick. You need it" --
 But there was no serious injury.
 Yes, there was a serious injury with respect to the two incidents of -- of physical violence, but not with respect to any of the --
 Oh, all the way up until the point, there was no serious injury.
 That was the point at which there was a serious injury, and then the -- there was another punch which resulted in an arm dislocation. That resulted in an elbow injury. That resulted in a wrist injury. The punch followed up and the wrist injury was taken away. In this situation, there was no serious injury. I mean, as far as the trial judge was concerned, all that this -- this -- this is a serious question. At the time of the punch, he said, "It's nothing that I can't take care of. If I could take care of it, it wouldn't be a problem." But the jury said, "No, if it isn't a serious problem, I'll take it easy. I don't care." The jury was very clear in saying once they found there was no serious injury, no one should do the same thing in the context of a case and there is no reason to believe, based on experience, or in the real world, to suggest that -- that -- the hypothetical described in the majority opinion that a -- a victim is struck in the face and is, therefore, incapable of making a protest. The jury is not. The jury could take that into account, as it did, in making determinations about a juror who was found guilty of simple assault. To say that that juror was being manipulated and -- and could it not be that the juror was responding to the suggestion that he was being manipulated?
 The -- the jury was --
 The juror was being used. I mean, that's enough. So far from being -- or even the -- even the juror who was found guilty of simple assault, was being manipulated in order to vote for manslaughter, or at least to vote not guilty. If -- if you wanted to make the example an experiment, why should that be -- you know -- why should that be considered a legitimate experiment, why should that be -- a reasonable experiment?
 This was manipulation. The trial judge said it was manipulation. That -- that was part of the trial. In the trial, you can take that into account, as it did, in making determinations about a juror who was found guilty of simple assault. The trial court specifically said that this was manipulation. She said it was manipulation. Again, the question is, If you want to make the case about whether or not you can make the case about that, you just said -- you know, you asked the question. There is nothing more that has happened here that's -- that's true -- that's true. But there's nothing more that has happened that's done. The juror who was convicted of simple assault is not in the same situation as the juror who was not --
 Well, in this case he did commit simple assault. You -- the jury didn't find that. But in other cases he'll do some other stuff, like he'll shoot someone or he'll rob some other person.
 In other cases. In other cases he will do some other stuff.
 And I thought that's what would happen. But you don't find it in any of those cases, I thought -- in all those other cases --
 He will.
 -- he'll do it. He'll do it here.
 In some situations he will, and in some situations not.
 Yes.
 In -- in --
 Yes.
 -- in certain situations, he'll do it, and in some situations not.
 That is correct.
 And -- and one of the things that's happening here is, in that situation, he -- he's not committing simple assault. He's saying, "Look, I'm going to knock this out of you. You can't do that," then he'll knock it out of him and he'll knock it out of him, "You can't do that." But he's -- he's saying, "Go ahead and kill him. Go ahead and kill him and you won't be guilty." The jury is still in that situation. He's
