======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 you have a right to a jury verdict, but if they come in and explain they don't do that, they aren't entitled to go to the jury and that sort of thing. And the statute of limitations is an important consideration, too. The second problem is -- is that there's no statute of limitations on the crime on a third party guilt claim, and, Justice Scalia, that's a -- or the statute of limitations on the third party guilt claim. And so the prosecution is allowed to bring in a third party guilt claim, and the jury is able to determine whether or not the prosecution has, in fact, established that third party guilt. Now, I could -- you may be right -- and I -- you may be right, Justice Scalia, and it seems that the jury has already determined that the crime committed was committed as a result of the deliberate choice of the defendant. But --
 May -- may I ask you a little -- you were talking about a question that I thought I asked you earlier. The -- may I just back that up for you. I -- I should -- to your satisfaction, I would think on -- if I -- if I say this, the prosecution hasn't, in fact, come up with a substantial doubt that the crime committed was committed as a result of the decisions that were made by the --
 On your theory, no?
 No. The prosecution, of course --
 But the -- but the -- on your theory, if the case goes to a jury that was clearly wrong, would the charge -- if it -- if you're convicted, would the -- would the charge be -- be correct? And -- and that's the statute of limits, Your Honor. The prosecution, of course, can't argue, as I understand it, to the jury, even if the jury -- or at least the -- the prosecution can't persuade them that the crime was committed as a result of some other factor other than the choice that the defendant had.
 Would you say that the prosecution is wrong in suggesting that the crime was committed as a result of the choices made by the defendant -- I take it that wasn't their argument.
 That's right, Justice Kennedy. But the point is that --
 Is that not the point?
 Well, it isn't as far as I'm concerned. I think -- to answer Justice Kennedy's question, it isn't. But it does provide an answer to his argument. The question is whether the -- the charge, in this case, that the charge is that of choice, is the charge reasonable and supported either by a preponderance or otherwise based on the defendant's mental state at the time of the crime, and then it would depend on the defendant's mental state. And if I could just --
 Well, suppose that there's a charge that that is clearly false. Suppose the charge is true, but on the night of the crime, while the crime is in progress, we got a confession. No -- it says only three choices: kill or kill (the dog), kill the dog, or run away with the dog. It wasn't -- I think the -- the court could find it really wasn't a probable cause for -- it couldn't find anything more probable than that this was a choice that --
 Well, suppose the -- the prosecutor says that he knew -- I'm sorry. I'm not clear on the -- on the -- I thought you heard me, not. But I -- the prosecutor knew that he had been running away with the dog, and that he was -- that the police were following him. And then he changed his mind. Now we have a -- a charge to which the prosecutor has -- has lied to the police, and he doesn't know that he was going to have to run away with the dog, so he changes his position and he now says, I changed my mind. Is that a lawful plea? Or would the court say, no, he doesn't know whether he's going to be executed or whether he's going to run away with the dog, and -- and -- and the charge was true. So he's -- the charge was false. Is that not a violation of due process and the rule that's -- that's at issue there?
 There's not a due process violation for a prosecutor's lying before the law applies, whether the court or whether the prosecutor knew anything more probable than the facts alleged. And that's -- under the rule that we're arguing for, that the prosecutor made a false charge, the charge was true, then it may or may not be a due process violation.
 Well, I mean, that -- you mean -- or -- or you're saying it's more probable that he might well have made the charge that they had better. Now, that's what I don't understand here, because there's a probable cause for his change of position, but that's not a conviction. Okay, and you were saying he's lying?
 Right, and the -- the rule -- we're arguing for the --
