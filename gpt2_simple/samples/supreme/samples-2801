 forms not inconsistent--
 And did --
 -- with section 2?
 -- or inconsistent with section 2?
 Yes, because you're taking a look at the language, and then you take --
 And --
 -- that language out of the context of 703(e) and you say that language is really on point.
 And --
 Mr. Phillips, the question we want to have you address is -- is this statute redundant on its face. It has -- it has the same provision. And the statute is very simple. The Court goes from State to State. Do we get down to the State primary schools in -- in the -- in the State?
 No, Justice Scalia. It's not as simple as that, Justice Scalia. It's got to do with States, and it's important to note that if one look at section 703, which is the statute that has the mandatory component, the Court in Sandoval looked at all the provisions in Sandoval and decided that all the provisions in Sandoval that spoke to the same provision, in fact, didn't. In other words --
 The -- the statute. Does -- does the -- does the Congress that put this language into the statute have the same intent or -- or have different meanings with respect to different provisions of the same statute?
 No, Justice Scalia. The Congress --
 So it -- it is --
 -- is the same bill every other State --
 -- does -- does have provisions as to different provisions.
 -- that it is the same bill as the -- the States. Does the -- does the same language in the whole law have the same meaning throughout the whole bill?
 Yes, it does, Justice Scalia.
 I understand the law it's so clear, but I don't know what your -- what your hypothetical answer to Justice Scalia's question is. I'm trying to understand your position.
 There's two answers to that. The first is that we have always argued that 703 is identical to 703(d).
 How do I look that up? (Laughter.)
 I'm trying to bring this --
 Now, let me ask this as a preliminary question. Are you opposed to 8(b) of the statute? I understand the argument that all the provisions of the statute are addressed to the same purpose. The purpose being --
 No, we -- we don't --
 -- that every provision in the 707A --
 No, you don't say that they all are, Justice Scalia. We don't think every provision is addressed to the same --
 Okay.
 -- same purpose.
 But -- but I'm asking you how do you respond or reject -- to the -- the argument that each provision is addressed to the same purpose which is why Congress chose to put the language about what State schools would be addressed to one State school system rather than the other. And I'm -- and I'm asking you how do you respond to that, because I have asked about 703 and you said, of course 703(a) is addressing --
 Well, Justice Scalia, I don't -- I don't think that's quite right. It -- it is addressing the -- the same provision. It has the same language.
 Okay, but it -- it does. So the -- the argument is that you think each provision of the statute is addressed to the same purpose.
 Right, but I'm --
 Now, why not? Isn't that the argument. And why not?
 Because it requires the same language. We didn't make out the same argument in Sandoval, and I'm trying to apply the same argument here.
 And you believe that's absolutely correct.
 If all?
 Yes.
 If all.
 Because we think that's exactly what Congress did in -- in Sandoval, and I think there was a sense that Congress was doing something different in Sandoval because at that time, what seemed to be the problem are two kinds of States. We thought of those two, one, we could read the statute in one or the other but this statute was -- was not so clear that you could read it in both. Maybe we read the statute different. We read it differently. And I don't know if Congress chose to have different statutes, but I'm looking at the same thing. And that's why I'm asking what you do in order to reject and that's why I'm curious to see what you do in order to reject and how do you respond to Sandoval.
 I'm sorry?
 You say Congress did the same thing in Sandoval.
 Not the same.
 Not the same. The same. And I wanted you to give me either one of these two versions; which one do you prefer. Now, you say the same, that the only difference that's really -- it's not just here's some language on both, he's addressing both as to one provision. And I'm asking for you to give me which version should I prefer.
 I'm sorry
