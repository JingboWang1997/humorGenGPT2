======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 In fact, you said this isn't the Federal Circuit?
 It's the first circuit court of appeals that the Government relies on, Your Honor, that has considered Saffold.
 Well, it seems to me that -- if the -- if the case isn't on the Federal Circuit, I -- it should be on the one that that was decided, after Saffold was decided, and the question was whether it was precluded by the -- the prior decision. So I don't know exactly what was decided in that case, but I'm guessing what happened, that was decided after Saffold had been decided.
 Justice Breyer, I thought there was a -- I think there was a prerequisites test, and -- and that was the test that existed prior to the filing of -- of this -- of this case. This Court decided Saffold not under the rubric of preclusion. And, if I could, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.
 Thank you, General Clement.
 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The argument made by Petitioner is fundamentally inconsistent with this Court's prior precedents. In Saffold, this Court articulated this proposition that if there is a Federal-law exception to state preemption determinations, such as preclusion, then States may raise the question under the Fourteenth Amendment, a question that has consistently been decided under the rubric of preclusion. The question in Saffold is not whether an appellate court's determination of sufficiency, even if based on state law, would be precluded. That question clearly is predicated on this Court's precedents, including in the -- in the last of the two postbell decisions in which this Court has recognized that preclusion applies only to an issue under Federal jurisdiction. In Saffold, this Court said in footnote 6 that it had never actually applied the concept of preclusion to an issue under Federal jurisdiction.
 Yes, but the issue in Saffold was whether the -- the judgment of the court of appeals under Florida law was, therefore, precluded. That issue was not before the circuit court.
 Well, it was --
 So, I mean, at least I -- at least I take it in Saffold, we did not decide the merits of the issue before the state court in Saffold. But there was certainly no issue before the Florida court.
 I -- I believe so, in Saffold, but -- but the -- this Court did not decide the issue below. What this Court did --
 Yes, but in the -- what -- in the state court in Saffold, it had decided it, and we've got to decide that in the main -- in the main judgment here. I mean, all it did was grant certiorari, just as in Federal court.
 In addition to granting certiorari in the Florida Supreme Court, the circuit court in Saffolds applied the "more convenient forum" doctrine in Saffolds, and vacated all but one of its cases. In the state court, however, it denied all but one of its claims. And it granted -- granted -- this was denied for review, but not for certiorari.
 So, I take it that Saffold doesn't necessarily hold that in Saffolds, the judge specifically found, and there was a remand to the state court for discovery, the issue was not reviewed in light of the Saffold decision in this Court.
 I would -- I would say no, Judge. I would say no, also, because the -- the district court -- the state court did the reviewing under its subject-matter jurisdiction, which is an intermediate appellate court review.
 And no -- no --
 No, I can imagine that, but I mean, assuming that's the state court. So, if anything, the state court has reviewed -- has -- has examined the issue below.
 But it did review that, in -- under the issue in Saffolds. And it has dismissed or denied all of its claims.
 But it rejected the entire claims -- and I think it -- there -- there was a final judgment in the Florida Supreme Court. And I think it's pretty clear, even under the postbell decision in the Fourth Circuit, that -- that, when you're dealing with a question under Florida jurisdiction, that's an entirely separate question than it would be under federal jurisdiction. If -- if you're -- if you're reviewing -- I would think it -- there -- that's a much more important issue than this.
 Well, to give a number that might be familiar to you, Saffolds was decided after this Court denied certiorari on a point of fact issue of record in this Court once. So, there was -- the issue of time was -- was open. I don't know that it was the -- I mean, I wasn't there. Anyway, in -- in -- in your -- I don't know that the issue
