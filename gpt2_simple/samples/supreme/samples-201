======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 the court that it has the duty to apply the ordinary, simple rules of civil procedure; and then it would be no more than the burden that had to be met by the plaintiff. But the ordinary, simple rules of civil procedure are different from the common law rules of procedure and, therefore, you'd have to apply a different rule to them. And in any event, it seems to me that the burden of showing why such a rule is inappropriate or not applicable is very high. The burden of showing that the plaintiff is an injured party and that's in fact an injured party. That would be a very heavy burden in the circumstances.
 And it says, "This defendant filed a complaint alleging a tortious act of negligence, but did not allege any facts that justify such a defense or support a claim of self injury". And yet it's not clear how that is an alternative to showing that the plaintiff's injury is substantially more than that alleged by the defendant, although, if it is, it could be an alternative to showing that the plaintiff's injury is substantially more than that alleged by the defendant, and, therefore, self injury is not supported by facts the plaintiff is alleging.
 But --
 I do think, and I don't want to talk about this, but maybe you can come back later to the issue of --
 In this case, the plaintiff's injury is the defendant's negligence. It was the plaintiff's negligence, but the plaintiff alleged the defendant's fault. The plaintiff alleged that it was negligent. In that circumstance, if the Court of Criminal Appeals had said, as you said, that the plaintiff was not sufficiently disabled to establish that injury, then that would have been the proper thing for the Court of Criminal Appeals to do. Because again, they are not required to make a ruling of what is reasonable. I think it's just very clear that they are subject to their own reasonable inferences of what is reasonable, reasonable and proper to go through. If they say it's reasonable to presume the defendant's fault --
 Now, we think that's a reasonable inference if you draw it, although it wouldn't necessarily be the standard of reason they used in this case. But I would --
 Oh, that was -- that would have been the -- the conclusion of the Court of Criminal Appeals. But we would certainly think --
 You think that's reasonable too and I could certainly imagine that would have been the conclusion of the Court of Criminal Appeals. What I would say --
 No. This is an appropriate case, Your Honor. I can see how the court of criminal appeals could have had a different conclusion, although I don't think it would be the -- the standard at the time. So, that is the way that the -- if the jury and those that are on the jury, in general, should apply the ordinary, simple rules of common law.
 But it may not make sense at the moment, because there has been no motion to dismiss. You could have another motion, I didn't see any other motion.
 No, Your Honor, the motion you saw is -- it's one that was filed in February. And what you found in those two minutes is, the defendants are a bunch of drunkards, and they've said that they will make up and they will never take no action that makes a difference to their claim of personal injury. And they are in violation of the -- and what that case is really about is an innocent man who is claiming the jury didn't give a full and comprehensive account, that's a question of -- of mitigation. And he had to be certain of that allegation, and that allegation was that the jury didn't give a full and comprehensive account. And you -- when they said they were not in violation of the facts of the case, and that was that, they are in violation of the allegations. And that was their conclusion and the reason that the defendant in this case, on our theory of the case, was not a fit to stand trial. So, what is the difference between that position and the position that the jurors at trial were under?
 The difference was this:
 But -- but it --
 Yes.
 And it makes -- it makes no sense to me that if the jury thought that there was some element of a mitigating evidence that was not available to the jury, then, with a sentence of life imprisonment --
 And you're saying you --
 -- that they had to have the exact information that they had on the record. Is that a sufficient answer.
 We can't say it's a sufficient answer.
 And it also makes no sense to me that if the judge and prosecutors and the jury didn't see what the jury could possibly have seen -- there were other questions on the case.
 I thought that was a sufficient answer.
 Because they didn't see what might have been a mitigating evidence.
 They clearly saw what -- what was the evidence of mitigating evidence.
 Yes, but that was not that evidence. And that is what the jury had, which were --
