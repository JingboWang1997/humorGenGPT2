======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 the States have sovereign immunity. And then Congress amended the section with a subsection that says ``the'' and adds ``under subsection (f)(5).'' And this was to fix a problem with section 7031, but it never, in the -- in the course of its proceedings, amended the section with the new subsection that says ``the''.
 I thought the purpose of the new subsection in 7031 was to eliminate that limitation.
 That's absolutely accurate, Justice Breyer, because that was to be true when Congress amended 7031 in 1982, and there was no intent to alter --
 I don't understand what else was being --
 The fact is this was amended the whole statute, not just the section. And I -- I don't understand the -- why Congress didn't intend the whole statute to be invalid. I -- I simply don't understand if it's invalid, in other words, as the Government makes clear, it is -- is invalid. But that doesn't, at the minimum, invalidate the whole statute. I mean, that would be true, and I agree with the other Justices. But you have your opportunity, you have your opportunity on this, to say that this is not a reasonable application of the statute. If you have a reason different than what seems to be an improper application of the statute and you don't say that, there's something wrong with the statute. If you say that isn't a reasonable application of the statute, I don't understand how you can claim that you have an independent basis for invalidity.
 I think this is just an attempt to fix a problem I saw in -- in the first couple of amendments to the statute. They are there in the -- there's a lot of confusion about this.
 Well, I understand.
 Do you have any further questions.
 I'll reserve the balance of my time.
 Justice Scalia, it's about --
 Thank you, counsel.
 If there are no further questions, counsel, I yield to the Government. The Government argues that the first -- the first amendment does not permit any kind of regulation, and in their case that is the first amendment. If the Government's case is not successful on the merits with regard to the question of the -- the first amendment, they would have to -- if they were to prevail, the burden of proof would shift to them to show that the regulation that Congress enacted with regard to first amendment conduct was reasonable. There is no discussion in the law of what -- how far that will be able to be proved or what proof is required by Congress in -- in the first amendment --
 Why hasn't one taken note of the fact that Congress had enacted two statutes dealing with speech on airplanes, and one says we're the only ones who can do that. Is that all it says?
 If you look carefully at these first amendment statutes, you can see that Congress has had two goals in mind. First of all, was to regulate behavior on planes and it succeeded in doing so, in order to avoid a huge amount of litigation. Second of all, if Congress had wished to have -- to take away the incentive for people to engage in the speech on airplanes and have a much more serious consequence, and had the ability to regulate, had the capability to make a difference in the lives of people who fly airplanes, then there would be no legal situation which would permit the Government to take away that because it is -- the Government is trying to achieve by regulating behavior in airplanes.
 Well, isn't there something more important, Justice Scalia, than a regulation of people who fly airplanes? That's what you're worried about, isn't it?
 No. It is actually this issue. This is --
 But let's assume --
 -- one way the Government tries to regulate behavior on airplanes, and what the Government has done is say, you could fly this airplane for 90 days and we can go out of our way to make your life easier. On the merits, isn't there a difference?
 Justice Alito, let me say that again. Here we are dealing with a statute which has a great many different areas in which this Court has dealt, where this Court has found that the Government has tried to regulate in general terms in the airfield. Here we are dealing with the -- first amendment of the United States Air Force.
 Why didn't they just say that? Why wouldn't they just say that rather than saying that if you have a problem with your friend who travels on an airplane, you can talk to her and she gets a free ride for the rest of her life?
 It seems to me that it would be easier to have a statute --
 And if they actually say that, wouldn't we be better served without the ambiguity that results there?
 No. Justice Alito, if they -- but you can certainly look at the regulations which are in the Congressional Report on the relevant provision, which is the one which deals with civil actions and they also deal with the -- they deal with the -- that --
