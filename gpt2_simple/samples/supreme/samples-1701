======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 they know that this is a serious, -- that's our best judgment.
 Mr. Baker, I guess we know this because we got a briefing from that Department. In what sense is it serious?
 The State is saying is there a violation of 18 U.S.C. 2254, a rule that --
 And -- and you don't think it is serious?
 No.
 -- but what is serious?
 That's one step further down the road. You got to say is there a finding that this is a serious offense.
 What -- what is serious?
 Your -- Your Honor, the State itself has not made a decision. It is certainly true that the Department of Justice has investigated whether these statutes are in fact being followed with respect to drug cases.
 Then suppose we never had that report.
 That would be --
 We would have no idea.
 This is an important question. Is this a serious violation of the Controlled Substances Act? The first step they would have to do to determine is is it a significant amount? Is there some indication that there is a pattern, a pattern of violation? Is there -- it's just a hypothesis of illegal activity.
 The Attorney General has asked for and is asking the District Court to instruct a hearing to be held on remand on what this -- this record.
 Yes.
 And to determine what you -- and what's the law, what's their law.
 The law of the first 10 months of that period does provide for the Attorney General to file an application under 28 U.S. Code --
 Do -- do you -- do you consider that a formal hearing?
 Oh, no, Your Honor. I --
 Do you consider it a formal hearing?
 I -- I do not agree, Your Honor. The Federal district court has to determine whether or not this is a --
 I thought you were telling us you didn't think it a formal hearing. (Laughter.)
 That was the result of a memo from the United States Attorney General, and I do not consider that a formal hearing.
 Well, you say you do not consider it a formal hearing.
 Of course, with respect to Schedule 1 substances, they say well, they're all in your system. They're illegal. They're in Schedule 1. Their --
 No. I'm just trying to clarify something. I'm saying with respect to Schedule 1 substances, they're all in your system.
 Absolutely. They are all illegal. They're in Schedule 1. They are all illegal under Federal or State law. And I consider it a standard factual basis for saying that all drugs that are in Schedule 1 are illegal under Federal --
 But with respect to the others, they're not in Schedule 1. They're drugs which are illegal in Schedule 1.
 Yes, Your Honor, absolutely, and with respect to the second five months of it, it also is true that there are other activities in the District which do not fall within the -- under the Controlled Substances Act. Again, we are not contesting that those activities are illegal. Again, with respect to the other five months, they are all in Federal court. Again, we are not contesting that those activity is illegal. And with respect to the second six months of the second six-month period, the -- the district court did not find any indication of activity that would fall outside the Controlled Substances Act.
 Do you agree with what I said earlier, that those other substances are not listed anywhere?
 No, our -- our position on that is that they are illegal.
 Well, they -- they are listed, by the way. The -- the district court did find them to be illegal in the -- in the -- at the time that the memo came out. Right? I mean, it makes reference a particular class of -- of substances which are not listed there.
 Yes, but with respect to the -- to the fact that they are illegal, as in fact they are, at the time the memorandum was written, it says they're illegal because of the fact that they're Schedule 1 substances. Right?
 Yes.
 Now, what did the -- what did the Attorney General -- the United States Attorney say at the time? He said what you describe is illegal, and it is illegal under Federal law. And then what was he saying? Did he say there was no other activity in the District that would fall under the Controlled Substances Act?
 Well, he did not have a specific allegation with respect to the other five and six individual criminal cases which is on this record. And with respect to the first six months, that report is not in the record. Now with respect to the second six months -- I -- and the United States Attorney's argument that this -- they are -- are just -- what I just described is not an allegation with respect to Schedule 1 drugs. The United States Attorney's brief says that this is purely --
 The United States Attorney, as we know him today, had two
