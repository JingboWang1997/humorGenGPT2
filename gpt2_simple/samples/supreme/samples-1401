 the way that the Constitution operates. That's a question of federal constitutional law that comes within Congress that has broad congressional applications, for good reasons --
 Suppose Congress did that. That would be a different case. Congress would not be dealing with this issue. I don't know what -- I mean -- in -- with all these other federal constitutional questions that we're facing. That would be different than a -- an Arizona --
 Exactly. But -- But Congress -- Congress could have, could certainly have made its own determination on that. Certainly, Congress could have said, you know, "You can't -- you can't get your passport. You can't go to Canada." It could have said that. It could have said that. But Congress clearly could not make that determination and so I think, at this point, I suspect many people would think that Congress would make that determination.
 Well, I -- I -- the -- the -- you don't know, Congress -- they never do it. In most cases, Congress doesn't even have the power to change the citizenship of people who are here. The -- but the -- but the issue is, could they. And, in the -- in the case -- let's -- let's take the most radical example right now. In most countries, if you're born here, you can come, you can stay, you can go out and do whatever the rest of the country can do. That's the only example that Congress could have said. "There is no provision in the Constitution that says, this -- we don't want you." But Congress could have. And here, there's -- there is no congressional law that says I mean, the United States could deport you, and the United States has not done it. It's like --
 Well, the United States has said that there are -- there must be an appeal from a temporary suspension or remand.
 Well -- Well, I think --
 But what if you come here -- if --
 -- which isn't like that --
 -- but which is like that.
 This -- I don't know, the --
 -- what if Congress doesn't give us the authority to deport those, but we know that if we do that, we're going to have to give the United States the authority to deport those coming from other countries. And Congress knows it well enough. And so, I think --
 Well, that's --
 -- Congress knows --
 -- and if Congress says, "Well, this way, the United States is going to have them." And if the United States takes them back, I think -- would it be the same? If -- if Congress didn't have to give the United States the authority, would that still qualify for the statute to the same extent that it just gave the United States the authority to take those people back?
 Congress has given the United States the authority to make rules in the immigration law. The United States has the -- has always given the United -- has always taken the authority to make the -- the rules as to the deportation procedure. With regard to those -- and those rules -- in the immigration act, that is the United -- has always passed on the deportation of those who have been brought here illegally. It's been -- it's always been, to the extent, -- has been in a "temporary" sense of the word "temporary --" -- the United States has given the President authority to come in and deporting people back -- deport people back --
 And --
 -- to make it easier for "us," the United States --
 -- so, that --
 -- so it's -- so, to put it this way, you -- you have to give it to Congress. Now, that might be true if it were done that way. But what does it do? And how --
 That --
 -- does it --
 -- that does --
 -- it could be the same thing?
 But that --
 -- that's why I say, no, Congress has given it to itself.
 Well --
 Congress -- Congress may have wanted --
 -- to do the same thing as you want --
 -- but Congress --
 -- has given you the authority to make that determination --
 -- but, I mean --
 -- of deportation --
 -- -- gave him -- had him.
 -- have a passport? Well, I mean, he -- I mean, the Immigration Act says, "There is no power of deportment except with respect to aliens here in the United -- in the United," so if you're -- say, you're a citizen, and you're a citizen, you're -- you're -- you're an illegal alien, you're going to be deported.
 And --
 -- who else are you going to deport?
 -- there are -- there are other people --
 -- and people coming here --
 -- here on the tourist, the foreigner, or whatever is it --
 -- that may have passports in the -- here --
 -- we're --
