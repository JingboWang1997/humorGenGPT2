 somebody knows of any other kind of activity.
 The statute is quite clear, Your Honor. It says that if you have not been in any State prison and you apply for this pardon, you must notify the district court, if you come within that statute, within --
 No, but that may or may not be true, Your Honor. I think we are dealing with a different question and it was a different statutory construction, that is, the question that Justice Breyer posed. It's a question of -- not the question in the question itself. We need further discussion about that. I guess you could -- you could just look at the law. Justice Breyer said if this statute has some kind of a policy objective, that is, to eliminate all federal pretrial releases -- excuse me, my -- my client, he had been arrested, then it doesn't matter what sort of activity his -- this person's had been involved with. Then one thing would be this -- it must be consistent with the policy objective of making sure this person is in control of his or her situation. That is not what the problem here appears to be. The problem appears to be the lack of understanding of the plain language of the statute, and the -- and the -- and the difficulty that the State faces in not knowing what the purpose of the statute is or at least what -- what other States are going to do, because it's difficult to see how they will comply with it. Thank you, Mr. Fisher.
 Thank you, Your Honor. If I could turn to that in the Court's opinion, it says it's a State policy and a Federal policy that they have no responsibility to take into account in sentencing, that they simply don't have control over the decisions that are made by judges after they have had a chance to consider it. That policy --
 How long does it take? In your view would any -- could any State take it into account? What --
 And -- and it's hard, and I -- it's hard to get at any estimate from the opinion because of the lack of clarity that's found there. But if this Court adopts a rule where States will treat this in the same manner as it already has done, it seems to me that it seems to me that it's going to be an easier case for the State in terms of having more time to think about whether or not to comply with it. Right? If the District court approves of --
 Does that apply in cases involving the provision of a -- a Federal policy that's inconsistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Edwards versus United States?
 Yes, no because the Supreme Court's decision in Edwards versus United States clearly provides a limitation on the ability of a State to exercise its discretion to impose a sentence that the Court has imposed as a matter of law. And I don't think the Court's opinion in Edwards v. United States really shows the kind of discretion that any State will abuse in the application of retroactivity. The Court, as Justice Breyer pointed out, is not always going to have the benefit of the -- of the majority, if -- if that's so. And I think that's the case here because when you look at the totality of the Federal interest involved, the best evidence from this Court would be the finding of a -- of an agreement by judges that this defendant's behavior on -- on this date and the facts, and his culpability as a consequence of that behavior, is something that they do need to take into account. The only thing that they should not take into account is the fact that, in this case, they were convicted because the District Court said he was an easy case to draw, because the record did not support that finding until -- not until after he had already been convicted. It would be hard for them to argue that an agreement was made under a constitutional breach of trust, but we believe that that -- and the fact the record here indicates that they both relied on the same finding in determining which sentence they would impose -- we believe that's the sort of consideration that a sensible -- an enlightened State would take into account in all the situations it might find itself in. If it comes out the other way, well, maybe I'll agree with Justice Breyer, but -- but the point --
 May I ask you the same question on this statute? I think you have a better example, perhaps, than -- than Edwards versus United States. Was -- was it ever used in this manner before?
 I think the answer to that question is "no," that this statute was never used that way. It was always used --
 I'm not sure what I'd look to to determine if it was ever used for similar purposes except in a situation in which -- in which the State made some substantial mistake in judgment or some fundamental error in -- and for that situation the State would be liable to be -- to be penalized. For what purposes would State be liable?
 Well, I think they're liable to be penalized when Congress enacted a statute which imposes upon
