======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 dozens, your position is clear, that they cannot punish us for speech?
 They cannot do that even when we do not agree with them. They are limited to speech. If you have a speech that the government disapproves of, they may suppress it in a case called Wilson against Lanier where it was challenged, but not the type of speech, the kind at issue in Dorrell, which was very clear.
 So it's a constitutional violation for them to do it without deciding whether you believe them or not. But that seems to me very vague.
 Well, the problem with that --
 Well, if the problem is vague, then they can suppress it in Dorrell, can they?
 I think they can, but the reason you should be very worried about that under our constitutional system is, is that the Government cannot regulate speech, to your core values about the meaning of the Ten Commandments.
 So that under the Constitution, if they had a list that is going to be used to say all the commandments were wrong, that's acceptable to them? That's allowable to them? That's okay?
 If they had a list that was going to be used as a pretext for getting rid of all the commandments, then you can suppress it. If you have a list that's going to be used to say all the commandments that you want to suppress should be suppressed, that, of course, violates the free exercise clause of the First Amendment. But still, you can suppress it. Your opponent and his supporters were concerned. And I don't mean simply worry. You know, worry about the fact that the war on drugs is costing our troops 5,000 times their normal combat duty and that's costing our officers thousands of times more serious harm.
 But you're willing to say that, even if they have a list of wrong commandments? You say, well, it's okay because it's wrong, because we can still have a point, correct?
 It's fine. It depends on the question of purpose. It's perfectly okay for them to do it, to have a point, to take that into account. And I think that's how it should work under our First Amendment system.
 Mr. Kneedler, you said last time you wanted to talk about the need for a broader viewpoint, and we think you were mistaken.
 Well, again, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not saying that you were wrong. We don't mean -- the Government, as I'm aware, can conduct this program if they have an expansive program. But there's no question that in order to do this job effectively, you need to have a range of viewpoints. You need to have a range of perspective to allow effective decision-making, to allow a range of points of view to be expressed. And I believe you're right that it depends on what the job is really about. It depends on the function that the particular employee is performing. This job isn't about saying that all religions are inherently good and all beliefs are inherently evil. It's about saying that we can all think critically about some things and ultimately we need to be able to come together as a society. It's not just about whether the government will not promote those beliefs.
 But you're saying that a different point of view than their argument is not constitutionally forbidden. That is, suppose that you're a member of a religious group and you have a different view of the truth than the government. Is there something wrong with saying that you're entitled to get the government out of your church because you've been given this church's religion and he's got something that the government dislikes?
 That may well be one instance, Mr. Chief Justice, between the government and religion. That's the point that has been made in Dorsey versus Falwell a hundred years ago as an argument for constitutional neutrality in the employment context. So I think that's one instance where what you would do, in terms of constitutional neutrality policy, is allow the government to conduct its program and then allow for the question of the purpose, as opposed to other things being a party to a discussion. I think it's important that we be able to come together as a society and deal with the issues that are before us and have a decision about those issues.
 You know, that -- you know, a long time ago in Dorsey, it was suggested that if they had a religious message, the Government shouldn't be able to use it as a basis for suppressing speech based on what the religious beliefs of the people of that group suggest about the basis for suppressing speech based on the basis that the religious beliefs of the people of that group suggest in principle. Was that suggested to be constitutionally prohibited?
 That was suggested to be constitutionally prohibited, as is well documented in the majority's cases on the merits, and that I think it is appropriate that we allow that under the First Amendment itself. There was a point there, too, where the court said that's one example of, you know, just some more
