======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 our legal system would apply even if the attorney's fees were not apportioned in accordance with the statutory framework? Why not? Isn't it true it's a common practice for attorneys to be split into separate, distinct entities as they do?
 Well, no.
 No.
 No.
 All right?
 The -- it is the attorney is split into two distinct entities. One is the attorney's fee, and the other is the attorney's fee per attorney, which is separate because it isn't an aggregate amount. That means it represents attorney -- attorney's fee multiplied by the attorney fee per attorney. One attorney fee is for the -- for one attorney. One attorney fee is for the attorney. One attorney fee is for the attorney per attorney. And the attorney fee in the second entity is a separate amount of attorney fee.
 Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.
 Mr. Goldstein, you have 4 minutes remaining.
 Well, the Attorney General's -- you have 4 minutes remaining. Mr. Goldstein.
 I'd like to go a step further. Mr. Chief Justice, I think the question is whether lawyers are separate employees or employers that are permitted to engage in joint and common business that's -- that's different from, or that's not allowed under the -- the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. And whether it's the first entity or the -- or the second entity, that's different. The problem is it can't apply in both the first and second entity, because no -- that can't work.
 And that is the difference that we'd like to --
 Right.
 -- argue in this case for you. And we're not asking you to change that. I'll leave it at that. Thank you, Mr. Goldstein.
 Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.
 He has 4 minutes left?
 Well, Your Honor.
 Yes.
 We agree. 5. He has 5 minutes remaining. Well, let him go another three.
 Well, now -- (Laughter.)
 Now, we agree with you in that, Your Honor. But let him go another one. The Attorney General's case is not -- (Laughter.) The Attorney General's case is not a situation in which we're asserting that the attorney's fees were apportioned in accordance with the statutory framework. The Attorney General's case is a situation in which we're asserting that the attorney's fees were apportioned in accordance with the statutory framework. We're not asserting that the fees were apportioned by the court in a particular way. They were apportioned by the court as a total amount, an amount that was equal to the lawyer's fee multiplied by the lawyer's -- multiplied by the attorney's fee per attorney, not simply multiplied by the fee per attorney.
 Well, the Attorney General's case, I mean, we could disagree here -- I could disagree here that -- (Laughter.)
 -- I think that would be true, Your Honor.
 Well, if you were in the attorney's fee case, if I were in the attorney's fee case, would we argue that? I don't think you would.
 Well, Your Honor -- I think we would argue that in -- we would say that in two different ways.
 Right, that would count, that would count it at the same -- in that case.
 Yes.
 Right. Okay.
 One might be that the attorney's fees have not been taken into account.
 I would argue that that argument could be made, Your Honor, because they are not apportioned per unit. They're apportioned per attorney, and their aggregate amounts did not change the formula. And the court couldn't, I think, change that. And the second part of that argument --
 Right. Well, what do we say if -- if that argument were made in your case?
 Justice Scalia, if you made that argument --
 Right. Now -- I have no --
 -- the attorney's fees are apportioned, we would say all along, in a very different way.
 Well, but the one case where we -- we agree with you is the Attorney General's case because as they're apportioned, we think, in a --
 What the Attorney General's case --
 -- we do not agree with you.
 Right. Okay. Well, Justice Ruth Ginsburg -- here's my argument. I'm not talking -- I'm not talking about the Attorney General's case because --
 You may have a different --
 -- as to -- you may have a different case --
 Right. Here's my position.
 -- where you don't agree because you say, oh, we're different people, we're different clients; so let's talk about our client, not the Attorney General's case.
 Justice Ginsburg, let me --
 No.
 -- -- put the same case in your view where you're arguing not the Attorney General's case, but only the Attorney
