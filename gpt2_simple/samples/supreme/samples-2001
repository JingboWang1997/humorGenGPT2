 same time by the fact of having a particular, an unusual number of claimants. It makes no difference if their claims are a tiny percentage of the total. We don't know if they were a tiny percentage because a small number of claimants filed with the agency. We don't know it because it's been filed longitudinally. So, why was there this determination made here? And I don't know how else, how else you could think of your claim, if it wasn't within the ambit of the statute or federal statute.
 Mr. Miller, could -- could I say to you, I will answer your -- you ask one question, one issue? And then one, the agency's response will show you another side of the record of people that come to the agency to receive help.
 Well, I'll put it. I know, I'll put it next to one of the agencies. What it's about is that this is just another aspect of the work of the agency. That it's there as a benefit for them. And, I think that was not what the agency -- the agency itself thought of this as.
 Why -- why can you answer one question?
 Well, I think that if I have to do that, so I know that Congress is being briefed -- the only thing I know about as far as Congress is being briefed is this decision. If I have to find a way to read it, which is what I'm trying to do when I read the decision, it would be a good idea for Congress to get the agency to do that. This is not a situation where Congress is passing a statute. The agency was passed into Law by the president, the first time it got passed. So then it was there, and then the president did not have to amend the statute to say, oh, you forgot to amend the statute. He could have simply said, you don't have to amend the statute, you've done it already.
 Well, now what's your answer to the -- the agency's argument that, the statute tells us that we make a determination about the number of claimants of this claim, and there's no statute on the books indicating that Congress intended this extra step? And yet it makes no difference if the statute had said, this is the number of claims that we'll make. I mean, if it's -- if it is a non-statute requirement to be in the statute, you have to have a statute to tell those people, and there's a statute to tell them, then the statute is not the source of the claims. So, if the statute tells us we make a determination for each single claim that is outside -- that is within the ambit -- you would say, there's no statute because it's not in the ambit with the specific requirements of a statute.
 That is correct.
 Then I'm -- I'm very unhappy that they decided this problem because of your decision about the statute, which was the very reason we are here, which is to say, Congress knows that it has the power of its amends to change it. And that's why it does that. And that's why Congress had nothing to say about it except for giving these two things. Why were we here?
 Well, first of all, even if you do decide it -- if you decide it's statute of limitations that need to be enforced, even if you decide it's not the statute in this case, even if you decide that you do not get to count that you would then say, Congress gave these people a chance, and those people didn't get a chance. There are, I think, three reasons. One of which is that the case does, in fact, -- I mean, there is -- there's at least a statute in this case. There is a statute for each person who is, quote, on time for eligibility, and the numbers are, from 6 percent to 20 percent for, from 1 in 2006 to 25. The total for all claims in this case -- well, the statute gives them a right to count the number of claimants, on the books. And there are, in fact, statutes in this instance, number of claimants and the number of adjudicated. Here, it is the, the statute. And then of course, number of adjudicated is a -- is a subset of the total adjudicated. The total adjudicated here, I think, is, is 25 as of the date of this decision. And the statute, as in, quote, 25, makes exactly the point that Justice Thomas laid out in his dissent. It's telling the agency to take a look and not count anybody. And if you count these people, we are going to find someone that is -- that was not on time for eligibility, and that is on the records, and that's what they have to do. There's an estimate of 2,700 people here that might or might not be ineligible for these claims, and in that, you have not received a statement. You
