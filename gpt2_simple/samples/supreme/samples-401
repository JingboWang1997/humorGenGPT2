======== SAMPLE 1 ========
's in the statute and it says only that if the defendant is indicted on a charge of perjury, that the statute applies only to the perjury charge and so that the jury is not permitted to convict of the perjury claim that is brought by that particular criminal charge. So, there's no doubt in the jury's mind, that that is the case, that they're not going to convict of perjury. In fact, this case is not that different from the prior cases. We are not, the court should not have tried to prove otherwise and the district attorneys' failure to do so will not be harmless and this Court will not impose a lower standard in this case.
 Thank you, Your Honor.
 Mr. Olson, we'll now hear argument in the United States v. Jordan. Mr. Olson.
 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In an ongoing federal case, there is a danger that a trial court will take a false step if he does not present credible evidence against the defendant. And in an ongoing federal case, that is the case that a State court has to consider. The Supreme Court of the United States has repeatedly upheld the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure that does not require substantial evidence of a particular guilt and has consistently held that a trial-court that takes the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure a false step will not be immune from Rule 34 review and that Rule 34 is a safeguard that is appropriate and necessary to avoid Rule 34's overbroad consequences.
 What do you mean by significant, what do you mean by significant? Do you mean in the -- in the Federal Constitution you have to prove that you're not the guilty? There has to be a lot of things.
 No, Your Honor. The case I do not -- we rely upon involves the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure, which doesn't require substantial evidence but which does require an inference from the accused's character in certain ways, certain activities. Under Section 1983, this Court has never said whether a State trial court must be compelled to present credible evidence of the character, guilt, innocence, or other. Under Rule 34, there's no such obligation, as a Federal trial court. It's the trial court that is required in this case. Here, the trial court, because of its failure to disclose --
 But you agree that there's not a need in a Federal trial court to raise sufficient evidentiary proof of each of the elements?
 There's been no evidence of Mr. Jordan's guilt beyond the character statement, the confession of the police officer, the evidence of the police officer's mental state, their lack of credibility, the fact that the police officers testified during the trial, and the statement of the trial judge, the prosecutor, and the defense attorney. There's been no evidence of Mr. Jordan's guilt beyond his role in a police conspiracy, and there's been no evidence of a conspiracy.
 All right.
 What are your defenses?
 Under Rule 30, a defense in a Federal trial would be a failure of the State to prove a particular claim. In the State of Minnesota, the defense is not, they're not trying to prove whether they're innocent or guilty. If they're guilty, it's that they're innocent. As a result of this failure of the State to do so, the jury has been instructed that they have to look carefully toward the prosecution's allegations of guilt in order to decide whether or not their verdict is reasonable.
 What do you say then about Rule 24? It sets the minimum threshold requirements for -- the trial judge, on the basis of the evidence of the prosecutor, that the jury must accept the Crown Prosecutor's statement and that if the jury takes it into account, that the jurors should accept it. If the jury does not, the defendant will not be allowed to proceed under Rule 24. Is that correct?
 Yes, Your Honor.
 Isn't --
 No, I just don't think that that's -- I can see in your argument that you'll still get Rule 24. But here you are not trying to get Rule 24. The trial court has heard a lawyer. He's an assistant prosecutor, and he said the case was a second-degree murder murder case, and in the trial court, there will be evidence of how the trial judge handled the case. In this, the trial judge took the prosecutor's statement and said he would accept it into account and he did not take into account the police statements, and it's the same thing in this instance. Let's say the trial judge got into Rule 24 and said the prosecutor's testimony in the second degree-murder case would be a reasonable defense to satisfy Rule 24 if it was presented in conjunction with the police statements. Would the jury, if there's proof of how the trial judge handled the case, still have to accept the prosecutor's statement that that's sufficient information in establishing a prima facie case?
 Justice Breyer, I would suggest that it is not sufficient evidence in this instance in Rule 24 because the police statements were not a
