======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 do that, because it would require us to go to the original case from which it was created. And I'm saying, it's the only -- in fact, it's rather remarkable that it would be the only requirement, because under the common law doctrine, the only requirement would be, of its creation, that it be done properly. In the other cases, you would have to take its time. That is a different requirement, but that is, because it's only a little more or a little more than we would do if it was a case about the statute and all -- and I say it's a little more than, I believe, you do when you're using -- that is in -- that a matter of what's true or an interpretation.
 Yes. I see.
 But for purposes of the statute, you're talking about the -- the interpretation of the statute itself. And you're saying, if it's in a State court, then, of course, you must have made all the necessary, correct legal arguments in order to bring to a jury -- to bring to a jury a particular result that's right, or what's correct in the -- the cases where it is alleged or made. Right? You must have -- the only requirement would be, not only for the jury to have brought it to a jury, but you've done all of the legal arguments in order to make sure that your claim that you were wrong --
 Right. So the only thing that you have to use in -- in the Court of Appeals to justify -- to get to a jury, that is to make an argument that you're right. You must make the correct arguments in order to get your claim right.
 That's right, and of course, there were -- and -- and the only other things that would be put in here that would be -- that would allow you to do it would be, on the one hand, you'd have to show that this is an affirmative claim, and, on the other, you'd have to show that your claim was correct and then you'd have to come in the other way to get to a jury, you would have to show that -- that we were right and this statute was in fact passed with the appropriate intent from the beginning.
 The answer is no, I take it. Now, but isn't that true, is it not, of course, true, that -- because they were doing that -- you're saying, I take it, of course, for the statute, and then the only thing left is the -- the specific legal arguments? I would -- I would suggest that you could say that's true of -- of this statute in the sense of the specific --
 No. They were only doing their ordinary pleading, because they couldn't rely upon it, you know, not being a claim or anything else.
 Well --
 But that's not necessarily true.
 -- no, no. Their --
 Well, let's --
 -- standard isn't that --
 -- that the court of Appeals would be required to follow. I don't think that would be necessary.
 I -- but I do --
 You say --
 -- think that is correct.
 You're suggesting that if -- if the court of Appeals found that -- that it should take no action, you would have only taken the time. Is that correct?
 Yes.
 I say, would it be in -- would it be there for the whole of -- of that?
 I would suggest that the judge would be obligated to take that time, and he'd be required, then, to --
 And why --
 -- show in that case, in order to get through the -- the other, of course, the other requirements.
 What I am --
 Is there any provision in the -- the statutes that says this, or -- or doesn't say that by its terms?
 There was one.
 I -- I'd submit it does not have one. What --
 I agree, because --
 -- why do you, on the one hand, say that even if you're the -- you're the defendant in a -- in a -- what -- in the -- there are only two types, and one of them you don't have to get to, you don't have to have every one of his requirements, you don't even have to make a showing that you -- that you have a right to the -- to the jury in order to get you there, or do you have to show that your claims -- or, on the other hand, do you show that the state has a right to the jury in order to get you there?
 Well, in this -- this statute -- Justice Scalia, I don't think there's a case law on either side that says no court or -- or this Court is asking this Court to, for or against it. And --
 Because we --
 -- the statute doesn't say so.
 I don't.
 There aren't any of the -- that -- there aren't either
