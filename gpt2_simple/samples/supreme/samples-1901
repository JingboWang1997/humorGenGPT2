, and in terms of the underlying constitutional violation it's just as serious.
 Well, your answer to this one is: Well, of course, Congress enacted the statute, and it's unconstitutional. But Congress certainly can alter the text so that it looks like it's been on a -- or -- or --
 May I ask you --
 -- roll since 1982. Could you give us a concrete example of such an alteration?
 Well, I think it depends --
 What -- what's the specific one?
 Well, my -- my second -- my second example that Congress could alter, and I think is much more directly implicated, is the fact that there are limits on the statute of limitations that Congress has to set out. And in the United States courts, for example, a statute of limitations violation does have implications. And if a court believed that there was a statute of limitations violation and that there had been an intentional effort to change it, then a -- a court could take a very, very serious inquiry under double jeopardy principles; however, this case, I think at least to my colleagues today, has raised three -- three very interesting questions about the law and -- and the lawfulness of the statute of limitations. The first is: How can we know that an -- an intentional attempt to change the statute of limitations is constitutionally cognizable if -- if the -- the statute looks more like a constitutional change, a Supreme Court ruling on the merits, a State decision on the merits, and it doesn't change anything else about the statute?
 Well, it -- it could be a statute of limitations violation if the statute was -- if the statute were designed to allow the defendant to come forward to litigate a crime that was going on at the time of the offense.
 And -- and the reason might be that it was -- and the -- and the statute said, I'm going to create a statute of limitations violation when -- at the time of -- at the time for bringing a motion to dismiss the case, rather than bringing it up on the statute.
 Well, again, the statute of limitations has to get its facts in place before the -- before the statute can be read to authorize a change. And in this case, we have -- we've just identified three problems that the Court has just described. The first is that this is a statute of limitations violation. The statute also looks like a Supreme Court ruling on the merits. The defendant, of course, will be able to file a brief on remand with regard to each of those three areas. That brief, of course, would have nothing more useful than the statute of limitations. The second part is that the -- the statute also looks like a State ruling in its entirety here. The defendant's challenge here is not an application for an enhanced sentence, which would have been a much more likely circumstance. The argument here is that the court should look to the nature of the State court decision as a -- a guide to what Congress intended. That's an excellent argument. And the third is that this statute is designed to apply a maximum period to mandatory minimum sentences, and yet it is only designed to apply a maximum period once --
 The statute does say you can make a mandatory minimum sentence longer if you want.
 That's right, but the statute doesn't do that. There are two things that --
 Two things, but it's also -- it's --
 -- it's not designed to do that in this statute.
 It -- it could be, but the second thing is, this statute says -- this sentence of a statute has to include the word mandatory. That's true in every State case. A -- a State statute has to include mandatory components. It doesn't have to have mandatory elements. This statute -- the first part of the sentence has to include mandatory elements.
 You wouldn't do that if this statute wasn't designed to do that. Why wouldn't you have?
 But that's not a question that is presented in this case, which is: The United States court of appeals found -- the Court found that this statute had multiple and continuous effects. The effects were of a cumulative nature, and it contained those three elements. Those three elements are all part of the statute and they have been enumerated and -- and are enumerated. However, there is no indication that Congress intended to change the statute this way in any respect. The final element is that this statute contains -- contains statutory provisions that confer criminal and sentencing consequences on all persons who, in effect, plead guilty or nolo contendere. The defendant who pleads guilty, of course, goes to prison, and the defendant who prevails in a trial is not. He is left behind to go to trial. The statute requires a defendant to waive a right to a trial, and that's the right- of-the-court, pleading. It says, that if -- if a defendant prevails in a preliminary examination, if the defendant prevails in the State trial court, he has the right to waive a right to a trial.
