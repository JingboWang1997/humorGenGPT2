, to a lesser degree. That's one of the reasons that state is -- is doing that, in the sense that if you -- if you -- if you're just -- just look at the other side of the ledger, Pennsylvania has been on the opposite. It was already in violation of its own state statute in order to give its license to do that. So I don't think -- I don't think that Pennsylvania makes any sense in trying to impose the sanction from the other state when they're going back into -- on one of the -- on another or they can just let those two states do it themselves.
 Mr. Dreeben, you are absolutely right that Pennsylvania doesn't make any sense unless -- unless we allow you to have one rule but you must follow the other.
 Yes, it would make sense in order to accommodate the other state. We can get to your case even if you're right in the third category, just as long as you would obey the other state statute. This Court said that it was the Federal Government's obligation to administer laws, to enforce the Federal statutes, even when it was the jurisdiction in a state that was being administered in the federal court in a state court. The Federal -- or the Pennsylvania -- is -- is not obligated to execute a Federal statute or enforce a Federal statute. So I think Pennsylvania would be a better fit for that -- for that statute to have a State effect because the Federal statutes are executed in -- in both ways. But what we've indicated is that the way that that might work out is just when we are dealing with -- when we are dealing with another State and there are -- there's no State statute that makes it clear that it is the Federal Government's obligation to administer the Federal statutes or enforce the Federal statutes. But --
 All Right.
 -- that -- that is a different matter, and --
 -- I don't -- I don't see what my problem is. Is it that you have some -- some of your arguments are just really inconsistent with this Court's precedents, including the opinion of our Chief Justice in the Smith case? And I believe this Court, of all things, should be looking at whether our decision is inconsistent with United States law. Isn't that -- what your argument says? I'm thinking of this case. I don't see any other --
 Well, you -- you've got some answers to that question, Mr. Chief Justice. Here that is what you seem to be saying.
 Yes, it's correct.
 And here, where the government is trying to impose something, they have not shown any compliance with it, is the State of Pennsylvania acting inconsistently with federal law.
 Well, I --
 All right. Let -- let me ask you a question I think is just curious. I'm -- I'm -- I want to know why you would think it makes a lot of sense to have the Court look at this case and decide, oh, Pennsylvania is a State -- a State license to do anything, and the Court should rule that it's inconsistent with United States law.
 Your -- but -- but I think the Court would look at the background of this case more carefully, in particular. And it's important here to just begin with a few things about the Smith case to understand --
 Okay.
 -- the Smith case. I mean, to go through that case, it says that there was -- there was a State law that you had to do that. Was the -- the decision of Pennsylvania to come to the Court with the Pennsylvania State law that was inconsistent with United States law?
 Yes.
 And that was the -- the reason the Court was in Smith.
 Yes. And the Court said, no. They did not show compliance, because the Court said the -- the Smith case said, we don't violate or we're not bound by the Smith case; but the --
 Okay.
 That's right.
 And then you say, oh, that's -- that's not in the statute and -- and you're not complying with it.
 Yes. But that was not what was presented here. That was not what --
 But that's why in Pennsylvania, you go in all the time. You just have two hours left. Right?
 Yes.
 And in Pennsylvania, you can give -- you can give an hour, you can make the argument.
 Yes, you may.
 All right.
 And how does that fit in? I mean, I don't understand why you want to go to a very lengthy argument if, even though it doesn't involve the merits of the doctrine, there is not any showing that Pennsylvania would not have complied with it.
 Well, it's not just what the Court --
 So Pennsylvania has an answer to that.
 Yes. The Court did allow us to go back in -- to go back in the Smith case and respond to the -- the Smith opinion. And what we said, because this Court said that if Pennsylvanians were allowed to do it,
