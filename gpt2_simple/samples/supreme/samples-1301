======== SAMPLE 1 ========
, I think the -- the -- the statute in this case is ambiguous because it says that this is a "bribery." But, of course, that's not true. If you look at the wording specifically in the context of the definition of "bribery" and the definition of "engaging," the definition of "engaging" is, itself, a "bribery." It's a "concealment or misrepresentation" -
 No, in Justice Breyer's case, if the case is a "bribery," there was also fraud on the Government. There was theft of public money. So there's fraud on the Government. But, under -- "bribery" in the statute isn't a vague statute. The statute is --
 Yes, I understand your point. But if we're talking, as I think we should, about whether or not "borrow" should be interpreted as encompassing, as this statute is, I don't think there's anything more ambiguous than there is in the context of the definition of "bribery."
 Correct, because Congress used the word "bribery" in the definition of "bribery," because it was clear that Congress was intending to use the word "bribery" in the broader definition of "engaging in corrupt activity or an effort to corrupt." And I think that's the context of the statute. The only language outside that definition, the term "bribery," is when the term is applied to the definition of "coup," because it encompasses "coup," in the sense that it relates to the fact that the definition of "coup" encompasses "the carrying on of a corrupt enterprise with a bribe." Once you have that word "coup" in that context, the Court should be left to decide whether or not "borrow" should be interpreted as encompassing "coup." But, I think, once you reach that point, then, in terms of our analysis, the statute has reached a dangerous place. Because a "coup" would be, as you are saying it, a "corruption." It --
 Well, would it include --
 -- includes some corruption that is involved in corrupt activity by the Government?
 Correct. It doesn't include corruption from the standpoint of the -- of the person or entity involved in corrupt activity.
 You can --
 -- "borrower" in --
 -- can you --
 -- you can --
 -- can you --
 -- can you --
 -- can you "borrow" that -- "borrow" --
 Yes. Right.
 -- that --
 That's different from this. Why --
 -- why? Because if I understand your question correctly, in an agreement with a lawyer and a patient, the client agrees that you will be prosecuted if there is evidence, and evidence that you are involved in corrupt activity, in violation of, quote, "the provisions of the indictment"? The client then --
 Right. That may have been the language of the agreement.
 That may have been. If you're talking about "bribery," and you're talking about evidence in a prosecution, then that term carries weight.
 Well, I think it's different than "coup." "Coup" is a broader term. "Bribery" is a narrower term.
 Why did you leave the phrase of the agreement with the lawyer, "You agreed, and you agree"? Why didn't you just say "You agreed"?
 That was a -- that was an attempt to use the term "coup" to make the client --
 No. So, is -- let -- if I understand what you're saying correctly -- is your theory that the -- if this is a criminal complaint, this is a -- the person has made a financial inducement, and the lawyer, or whatever you call it in New York, thinks, "Well, go ahead and pay it off." The lawyer goes in, finds out that the client makes money, even though it does -- doesn't pay for what he did, but he says, "Oh, you know what, I've got a lot of client funds. I'll handle it." The client --
 Right.
 -- "go to the lawyer, and, of course, the lawyer can't handle it."
 They can. The lawyer can say, "Well, you don't care. Go ahead, right now."
 Right.
 Now, if the lawyer --
 Right.
 -- takes some money and puts it in a bank account, they can --
 I don't understand. Why should the lawyer have a lot of money even when he --
 Well, I agree with you, but --
 And if he said, "Look, I'm a little bit of a stretch here, but I've got a client with a big account, and it's a good amount, and now you tell me what I ought to do?"
 I would disagree with that
