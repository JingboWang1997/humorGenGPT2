 correct, so why not try to make a case of that and get it before the trial judge?
 Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg did --
 Do we have any case on that? I'm not asking you. [Laughter.]
 What I'm interested in is the case -- case in which counsel has argued that it's the judge's problem.
 That's the case, Your Honor, in which counsel said it was the --
 Yes, and that's a -- that's a case on that?
 Yes. In the Saffold case, Your Honor, the --
 Yes. Okay. Okay.
 And at page 7 of the joint appendix?
 In footnote 6, which is the joint appendix, where it says the -- the defendant filed an answer, the defendant filed an answer to the claim. At that point, the judge said, yes, I can decide, this claim is filed under Batson because it didn't prove a claim in the --
 No, but the -- the objection was made not by Mr. Stris, but it was the judge's problem before, and he couldn't solve it.
 That's correct, Your Honor, but it was not the judge's problem at the time this Court considered the claim. The claim is --
 Yes, but then -- but then why -- then why hasn't the claim been decided by the judge on the basis of a single litigator rather than by a five-judge panel?
 Well, Your Honor, one problem with that is that -- in the Saffold case, the Court said that the problem was, if there were four judges, that the first and fifth, in addition to taking the same oath, did the same duty. And then in the Saffold case, it was the judges that determined, and then the judges --
 What the -- what the Court thought before it, I take it, would be the case that -- was in your view?
 It was the judges in Saffold --
 Yes. I mean, the Saffold case says the -- the judge decides --
 That's correct, Your Honor.
 Does not -- does not the problem here go to the -- to the independence of the lower courts? As I understand the Saffold case, the claim was only dismissed when the two -- two parties reached an agreement. And, at least I take it, the two parties that argued -- or both parties argued the claim, were the parties that had originally brought the case, and so there was no further discussion about it afterwards in the -- in the Saffold case. What the Court said, though, is that the lower courts may be capable of coming into Federal court and adjudicating federal claims in a case that has not been fully tried, under the Court's authority, the Court had not yet addressed the issue of the merits. So under the Court's authority --
 The same -- the same question might apply to the case that you're -- and Mr. Stris is raising. You know, I suppose that he has the Saffold case. It -- his issue is, as I read the record, the judge said, let's treat the -- the claim like the appeal. The judge said the appeal is a different issue. The case gets sent back to the State court. If he holds, then the appeal --
 He did hold it and said, but we can handle this, I think; because we're going to dismiss with a ruling that's good enough. So he went ahead and held it anyway.
 That's absolutely correct, Your Honor.
 And I would have thought -- I -- I just couldn't have found -- that's what the Court said.
 That's my question, Your Honor.
 I don't think -- I don't think he -- I don't think that he had --
 He said we can handle it and hold it.
 He -- if --
 He has the Saffold case, I believe.
 He has at some level the Saffold case. At some level. At a certain level, Your Honor.
 Well, the problem is he says it's still in State court.
 Your Honor, at some level that's correct, Your Honor.
 So he's not talking about --
 He's not --
 -- his decision.
 -- holding it in State court, that when we reach a Federal habeas action, all of the -- the State court case is going to come out.
 Well, that's -- that's not what he said. He said we can take Federal claims and dismiss them by reference to Federal habeas.
 He said that.
 Because he said -- what he said was we can dismiss by reference to -- it would depend on if the appeal is a Federal -- that is, an appeal on a point on the Federal merits.
 As Justice Alito's question suggested, he said --
 At some level.
 -- we -- we can dismiss it by reference to Federal habe
