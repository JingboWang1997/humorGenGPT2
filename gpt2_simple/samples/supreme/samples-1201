======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 It's an old statute in which they say if a person is shot, at least two other people are. So it says two. So they would have to be within two or three blocks of each other. So they have to be within the boundaries. So they're not just being selective in who they are, they have to be right. So it is in fact a more difficult line to draw because it's not a lot of cases, and that isn't what Justice Stevens asked.
 Well, I don't think he's asking for the right to be left alone. I mean, let's take this other case the government is challenging as well and then you have a lot of cases like this and there are probably even more you just don't know about and so you say the State has a First Amendment right to exclude people. Well, I think this is a real different case because the problem here is that the majority of the cases here are already decided by this Court. So that is a real big issue which --
 I thought the -- I thought the -- one, I think the question was whether a defendant can always go to -- you know, to a different court for a new trial.
 Correct.
 Which is one of the problems with this. One, it's so burdensome and -- and you're looking forward to all these cases because this one has already been decided.
 That's correct. I think your --
 Why not just say we -- we, we just say it is a matter of time before the State loses another case with that particular rule in view.
 Because there's a good reason that a defendant, that a State court must come to a State supreme court for a new trial without a new trial unless there's an abuse. And that is, there's been abuse of this new trial rule in the State of Virginia for, for twenty-five years, and it's only been a few in the recent years. So that's how long the abuse has persisted. If the abuse had occurred right now there is no precedent. And therefore, the reason that, the reason they don't need a new trial at the moment it has all to do with the new trial rule, they can bring a new trial at all. So the problem is in this case, I don't think Mr. Fry, the State would be able to use that in the very -- the first instance because there's a constitutional right which this Court has already invalidated in Virginia State courts of the case and they would be in a better position to contest the new trial --
 The right to trial is a part of the Fourteenth Amendment, isn't -- it's all -- isn't?
 That's correct. So, and that was --
 So, is that what -- is that what the right to trial is?
 That is a component of it. I don't think it's --
 Okay.
 -- all that's required is that a defendant that's going to come in in the State court under their rules to have a trial must go and ask for a new trial under the Federal constitutional system. That's also going to have to be at least one-half of what you have in the Federal system. And that --
 No?
 That one-half doesn't have to be the best that they can come up with but it has to be --
 But the Federal system does the -- it's what they do not have in Va. It's the same as the Federal system.
 The Federal system has a lot of features. The most important is that the Federal system does not bar the State from prosecuting a State man or even a Federal prosecutor. It bars the State from prosecuting the Federal person that is the predicate for prosecution -- but it also bars a Federal grand jury from trying the Federal person whether he is guilty or not guilty of a Federal crime or not. And so the Federal system works.
 Is that right or not?
 That's correct. If there's an abuse in any of these areas that are the predicate for prosecution, the Federal system makes the Federal person look guilty. If the State did not prosecute the Federal crime as the predicate for prosecuting the State grand jury could have been in the State court or the Federal court on a Federal charge, the Federal system makes the State look innocent, whether there's a State grand jury or not. So the Federal system works. Now if the abuse were -- if the abuse were at the level of whether it's a felony or a misdemeanor, but if the abuse were, if the State had made the State law that it was a state felony punishable by three years to six otherwise there may be a State --
 You're -- you're -- you're trying to give the State an argument. I don't see if that's the argument. The State doesn't have to tell you that the Federal system is no obstacle for its State prosecutions; the Federal system works.
 No, Justice Scalia. If you're a Federal grand jury in Virginia and there're State misdemeanor charges, there is
