======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 they can't, and then the trial --
 The trial, though, he was not in the courtroom, and it may have --
 The -- the trial could have been the same in the courthouse on the other side, so if, you know, if our law is correct, he couldn't have had the same counsel in the courtroom that he might have had if we're right.
 Do you think this Court could reverse the jury that decided that they did not get a fair trial and let them go back, just let them know that they are entitled to one piece of evidence for that reason?
 I think not, Your Honor. I would say that there are -- there are cases --
 Where -- where can we send their case?
 But certainly not the way we would have a first hearing argument, Your Honor, because that's what the judge has the power to make in that case, and I can have people in my -- in my office, say, well, I -- but that's -- there isn't a right to have them --
 Yes, you could have a first hearing argument, but only because he's not here.
 But, my point is the way it would work, if we were in the -- in the case of an appeal, and you had a first hearing, the district court would be acting as if it had a --
 I -- I didn't realize -- I don't want this -- I just -- I really didn't think I had to write in this case what a typical first hearing looks like, even when it's got this strange, you know, something about a reasonable inference, or a reasonably inferred basis, I can -- I could imagine in that case if I see something like a reasonable inference -- I can still go to the other side and say, I'm not going to grant you summary judgment on your part. The judge could say, no, you don't have the -- the defense. There is no basis that would bear upon your ruling there.
 You have -- you have to --
 It's -- it's just --
 -- it's just a --
 -- just a -- a standard that has been in effect for a long time, a fair trial.
 I think there -- I think there is --
 I -- I think you're arguing for a --
 -- the more reasonable standard.
 -- it will take a jury and it would require a jury at a hearing, but in your case --
 But the --
 -- then --
 -- the burden is on the defendant. I think there -- it would be difficult in a sense to determine at the penalty phase what their burden would be with a first decision with respect to an appeal.
 In the -- at the penalty phase, Your Honor, it is -- in that circumstance, it would be the same, because the -- the decision could be appealable and the defendant could bring --
 Yes, but suppose that the trial attorney believes that his client should have gotten to the jury that he wanted to. The jury would have, indeed, had the right verdict.
 Your Honor, that can have two, and it would make sense based on the defendant's desire to come into court that that would be the standard of a fair trial. That was the standard that was applied in -- in Florida because of a provision of the Florida constitution, in the -- in the appellate courts that were created.
 So, in fact, when you say we're not in the case of deciding the defense, you mean that your argument is the case of the trial judge? That's the argument that you're making. Would that be a proper standard, that the trial judge should have been objective?
 No, Your Honor, and that would be the way the trial court would have done what it had to do in this case and what it could do in -- in a sense. There are -- and here, a defendant who wants to bring his case at the penalty phase can do that even if he's not in a position to be in court in a sense --
 And if you have a different -- suppose you had a -- a trial court who wanted to change his mind and wanted to reverse the verdict. Would that have to be done by statute as well as by law?
 It would be a function that would be a function.
 Oh, what would the statute mean? What kind of a statement statement would it go to?
 It would probably go to the trial court, but the trial court is going to decide the statute of Florida. But in this case, I think the defendant would have a defense counsel, the State --
 The -- he would have two -- at the trial --
 -- defense counsel.
 -- attorney. He would have to hire at least two lawyers.
 I'm sorry, Your --
 No, he can hire at least one.
 He -- he can choose.
 So, if a defendant wants no lawyer at all, well, fine, so do the defendant.
 Yes, Your Honor, and that is
