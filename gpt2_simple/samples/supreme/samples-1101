======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 no argument, you can, you must have an actual hearing in front of a judge, because otherwise, why would you want to have an actual hearing ?
 Well, I mean if they could -- if they -- if they have an actual hearing, why didn't they have an actual hearing earlier under the way they proposed in this case? But under the way they proposed in this case, why didn't they get an instruction to -- you know, for the jury. Why couldn't they get an instruction to the --
 I was under that, I was under the instruction to -- the instruction to the jury that the State argues on appeal was erroneous.
 It is correct. I'm -- we're -- we're asking for instruction in -- to the jury to the jury. You know, that's a very, very important point because if instruction 12 or 11 are right, the jury is going to understand the nature of the case. And it is quite clear from this Court's decision in this case that a good defense can hardly be successful unless the prosecution has this instruction.
 But they did get an instruction. And this is in the second trial. This is a two-and-a-half-year sentence.
 It is correct.
 What is your theory of the case on the facts of the two trials you cited?
 The only argument, Your Honor --
 No. No, I'm not. All you're saying is that in the first trial, they were unable to understand the situation.
 That -- that is correct. If instruction 12 or 11 is right and the jury is left in confusion, which we believe there was, they were unable to use a particular piece of evidence during that trial, they would probably be able to use the more obvious pieces of evidence that have more similarity than not. The State objected to that in the first trial, and this Court -- this Court did not find that there was sufficient similarity. This Court found in the appeal that the State's argument about the use of the -- was an insufficient basis to adopt this instruction. And if there are other questions, maybe Mr. Cooper can finish his answer he started with.
 Thank you, Mr. Cudahy. Mr. Salmons.
 Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: There is a very serious problem with the State's argument in these proceedings that they could have adopted a different instruction for the verdict unless there is a reason to do it else in this case.
 But, he seemed to say there is a reason that they didn't.
 The State's argument in these proceedings is that the State must have been in complete ignorance and that the judge must have been ignorant of what the instructions were.
 But that was -- that was the objection. That was your -- your argument in this trial that it's the jury instruction, not the judge's.
 Yes.
 Well, it was --
 So, it's --
 -- so that in your view, that's a good argument and therefore, there was a good reason for them to say that's the jury instruction, not the judge's.
 You're correct. The argument of the State is -- is that if they had, instead of the verdict instruction, a jury instruction to the jury, the State would have had more information about each of these things. We're not asking this Court to decide if they had some knowledge. We're asking this Court to -- to find it was the jury instruction, and therefore, they were right, in this case. They were not wrong in this case that -- that they could have had that instruction. You can argue, it's not perfect, but this was the jury instruction. They're asking for this Court to make the same finding here because that's not going to be correct in any case with these three defendants. The State must have concluded that their explanation is impossible. And so, the -- the argument they're trying to make here, and the argument they want to make in -- in their briefs, is that if that instruction had been given for the jury, there is no suggestion that the instruction they chose was defective or improper, and therefore, they would have gotten it differently. That's the only explanation. The -- the argument we have to offer as a matter of law is that the instructions were as good as they could have been, and the jury instruction was not as good as it could have been. The State, we think, must have concluded that there was no reason that they put on the jury instruction. It could have been the jury instruction, or they could have used the instructions from counsel. But if they did so, or if they put on the jury instruction the instructions from counsel, those instructions, which they used, would have got a better understanding of these cases. The State has had more than enough reasons for trying to make this case look good to the jury, and has done so. As to the -- the instruction, the instruction, it's fine. It's OK. I mean, the only problem
