======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 was the key thing to bear in mind: the -- the question is, which is it, the test is, is it more likely that the defendant did it intentionally, and I think the Court, in weighing that, has to recognize that the burden would be on that defendant, under the test, to prove something beyond a reasonable doubt. That's really what I think the Court's test is trying to look at.
 And you're not willing to give him what I call the "loyalty test"?
 I --
 Is that what you would ask that defendant? What would be the test that you would look at in order to decide?
 The test would be loyalty to the United States, your loyalty to this country, your loyalty to your family.
 If you were to be able to be loyal to all of these things and not to the defendant, you'd want to be --
 That's why I have an oath to discharge the Constitution and serve my country. That's why I --
 Do you take that oath on a quarterly basis?
 I -- I do, and the oath is -- is administered by the Chief of National Security --
 Has to be an American citizen.
 -- and my husband's oath of fidelity is an oath of allegiance, which is -- and he takes the oath the same way the President takes the oath as the President is sworn in -- by the Chief of Marine Intelligence.
 May I interrupt you a sec? What about the "solely for this country, this is America, and here -- and my name is, sir" clause, and then the President?
 Yes, I -- I would say "solely for this country, this is America, and here I have a President." But --
 Right.
 -- I believe under the First Amendment --
 Yes, and that's the -- and the point -- and that's the -- and that's the only concern. So is there really any difference? Yes, there's difference. And I'm not sure whether the -- the Constitution says that.
 Yes, but I don't see any other way to analyze such a difference.
 I take it that -- that the --
 There must be some difference because -- there's -- you're doing -- you're using the "solely for this country, this is America, and here I have a President" language.
 Yes, so far as "solely for the United States." But the way --
 The only way to look at the other part of that -- is to take that word as a whole that's part of it, and then do a comparative analysis of this other word, and so you've got two things going on and you have to be able to decide one way or the other.
 Yes, but -- but I think if we look at the whole, that would suggest that "solely for the United States," that part of it does speak of "solely for" the United States, that part of it doesn't make any reference to "solely for any foreign government," just the other part. And that's the -- one of the cases I think that I cite in the brief, Justice Ginsburg, in which the Court has not recognized the existence of the individual right, as being a subset. This is not the case. And on those facts, Justice Scalia, that would suggest to me that the individual right, the First Amendment and freedom of speech, freedom -- this is one of those, but you would have to say that there ought to be a second right in terms of the First Amendment, the freedom to speak your mind, but the individual right is not implicated. So on the First Amendment, freedom of speech isn't -- isn't there a second right as far as speaking, but I think the Second Amendment is implicated. And the First Amendment requires the speaker take a position and the Second Amendment does not give you the right to do so unless you take a position of liberty, the right to self-expression, to self-expression in order to take this position as to which you would have to take it in order to be part of a group. Now, the second point with regard to the -- to the individual right is that it doesn't say what you think you ought to -- you ought to write as a matter of -- of personal choice. The second point here is that the First Amendment, and the First Amendment applies broadly in a way that is not only -- and that is not only -- the same type of speech is at issue, as is -- and I'm not just talking about, in the abstract or general cases. The specific content of the speech is at issue because if a speech is being taken as a matter of its own personal, individual choice, not for the purpose of a political, partisan or other objective, but just on the basis of the speech's particular content, then it doesn't belong to the government, unless that personal choice becomes a political statement.
 Mr. Kneedler, if I may, you have about five minutes
