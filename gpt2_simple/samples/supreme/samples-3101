 -- which is a violation of section 1 of the ASARCO-DOE Act.
 Well, I'm -- I'm glad you brought it up because --
 -- that I can't --
 I'm sorry, Your Honor.
 Oh, I -- you know, that can't be right, because in section 3501(a)(43) of the INA --
 I think --
 -- it --
 -- it doesn't mention the word nonimmigrant, but if it did, it would -- it would be covered.
 Oh, please. I'm sorry?
 This statute covers -- it covers a -- an alien who arrives at U.S. soil without an inspection, after a removal proceeding, and who has a reasonable ground for believing that they may qualify as an American citizen. It would then cover --
 Well --
 -- if -- if --
 -- but -- but in a case -- a case that we cited in our brief, it's not even mentioned. The INA only applies to citizens or to foreign-nationals who're here as permanent residents.
 Well, there's nothing -- it doesn't --
 Yes --
 Well -- well, does -- does it --
 -- in the -- does it --
 -- that applies for a U.S. citizen or U.S.-citizen who is here.
 We're --
 They can't -- does it apply for somebody in the -- somebody from a country which, as Judge Pertwee wrote, is not a member of the European Union, so no -- no U.S. citizen that we know of. What -- what does it apply for?
 The -- our position, the Soliciting Clause, and the First Amendment, is that it applies for an alien who is an American within 6 years -- and under 6. It applies --
 Well --
 -- for a person at -- an American.
 -- well, I mean, 6 would be -- it could be 10 years -- it could be 20 years. What -- what else -- what else -- what else does it apply for?
 Again, the Soliciting Clause requires the Government to demonstrate a compelling foreign national interest. We've done that. We prove, on the face of that --
 And I -- I suppose I understand -- if you -- if you win this case, I take it, you win -- that they win on the foreign-nation ground, too.
 Yes.
 But if -- if you win, it doesn't matter that they got here -- they've got every right they -- they should have got here -- if they come to this country and they don't know anything about the State of New York, about their own rights and whether a foreign-national ought to be treated any differently from another non-citizen.
 That is correct, Your Honor. I do need to be careful, though, because this case was decided before the INS Act was passed. The way the INS Act passed -- and this is at page 632 of the ASARCO-DOE brief -- the Government does not have to file a motion with the Court, a standard that applies to virtually any foreign national for the purpose of filing a nonemergency foreign-national removal petition. And so what the INS Act does is create certain circumstances under which a foreign national may obtain that relief. And this case is one such circumstance --
 This is a question of --
 -- the cause of immigration law.
 -- a question of how to -- how to interpret the AEDPA provision, and to what extent do you take it?
 And -- and it's -- it's certainly possible to interpret it the way that the Court does, Justice Kennedy, and -- and this Court does use the AEDPA statute of limitations to interpret foreign nationals' rights. It did so in a similar case -- or a number of similar cases in the 1990s, such as the -- the New York City Attorney General and the United States --
 Well, what are they that we are not familiar -- I mean, what are we -- they're -- you know, you know, what is it? Are they that they are -- that we can't -- are they an American?
 No. In -- in an abstract sense -- in an inalienable, inalienable -- and that phrase is most succinctly expressed in the -- the language -- the INA -- the IINA -- foreign nationalization -- an alien cannot later -- can later become an American citizen or a -- become an American -- because of his prior criminal convictions, whether or not he is a crime refugee. For that reason, the individual must have committed a crime, and can then be subject to the criminal alien provisions of 1529, 2215, or whatever it is, 1331 and 1348 unless the Government proves otherwise, and even then, the statute requires the statute to be applied by reference. And this case goes the furthest, because, unlike those other criminal alien cases -- or, I would like to be
