 to use to determine a public purpose, a public objective, a public purpose, and a public objective." Now, that's -- I don't think that what he meant by "public purpose," and I don't think what he meant by "public objective," and I've always thought they were quite different. What he has said is, "As to whether some portion of this will be an appropriation, whether some portion of this will be money made by the government for the use of taxpayers but not the other portion for the use by some other source, I think that's easy to come up with, just from looking at the appropriation that way." So, to the extent he's trying to help the agency, the only assistance it provides is to avoid a burden of analysis that I don't think the agency needs. But I --
 May -- I mean, the argument you're making, Your Honor, is, the agency can go ahead and take a taxpayer-financed public works project in lieu of -- of the -- of a -- a grant that it otherwise could take to run it itself.
 That's correct, Your Honor. And it -- it is, you know, the agency doesn't have the burden of the burden-of-evidence burden-of-evidence analysis. What Congress gave the -- an express-reference statute allows the use of a particular private appropriation to fund a particular -- a particular public works or construction project. And here, we don't have any private-appropriation exception to the general statutes.
 I want to get back to an earlier --
 There is a private appropriation for the work of the agency, whether it was a grant or whether it was a appropriation that wasn't part of the appropriation for that work. But, as to whether it was a grant or whether it was a appropriation, the statute at the time was very focused on the latter. So, my question to the Agency for Federal Aid -- I think to the Agency for Federal Aid, I think Congress has -- you have -- that it looks to the grant for the work. And if it was a grant, it doesn't matter how much it was. But if it was a -- it was an appropriation that was part of the appropriation and part of the work, it seems to me the Agency for Federal Aid can use just -- can look at the grant and say, "That's part of the appropriation, part of the work." The taxpayer will get a deduction for all of the work, the non-taxpayer, it seems to me. And it gets --
 But it doesn't, by definition, -- and the Agency can do this, whether it's a grant or whether it's an appropriation. It's part of the appropriation --
 Well, it's --
 -- or whether it's just money that was there.
 Well, it's not just money, but it's also the nature of the public works or projects. The work was done at taxpayer expense, and some of the fees, if you look back through the -- the legislative history of the Act, it is very clear, both the taxpayer and the -- the contractor, as you have in -- in the briefs, that it was a public-works project --
 If --
 -- involving taxpayer money.
 -- if the -- if the Agency could do the -- the preliminary work, which -- the work was not done at taxpayer expense, that's a problem?
 It might not be that severe, Your Honor, but as I understand it, the Agency could do the preliminary work. It could perform the essential functions of the agency, but, as far as it's concerned, it didn't, because a private party had the right to perform the work for the taxpayer. The -- the contractor could get compensation, but -- I mean, who's to say when it's a private-private-rights-defense case, the contractor would be able to sue in an agency-tort. The contractors have a burden-of-proof burden-of-evidence burden of proof that is lower than on an agency-torts case, and that makes sense. The -- the agency has said -- the government officials, including the President, have, over and over again, said that they are relying on this statute because of the way that it applies to the general agency-torts actions. And that's consistent with this case. The Court should extend it to private contractors, because it's a general rule that, if the IRS was sued for a $1,000 tax liability, to make a claim for damages would be a burden of taxpayer -- a burden of proof. The only way they can say, "No one's getting compensated except as a result of the government having put money in its fund," under the Act, under the statute by itself, would be to say, "Well, this is our first line of defense." They have not said that here because, in a tort case for example, if the IRS had used money that it -- that it had deposited with it for the
