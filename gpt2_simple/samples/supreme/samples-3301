======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 of the question the Ninth Circuit has been -- has been asked in this case. You said your reading would make a big difference. What is your response to that? And what is your response?
 First of all, Your Honor, the -- there is no evidence whatsoever that a -- that a defendant could have qualified as a "reasonable time" doctrine -- excuse me -- a "reasonable time" defense would have met any standard of what is -- under -- as the Ninth Circuit has construed, the standard is: "reasonable time" and "reasonableness." So, I simply can't think of any other.
 In which case, you're talking about cases in which the plaintiff in such a case had a standard, one of the -- the standard of the Federal statute, some kind, saying the time is unreasonable under the statute. So, he can say the standard is unreasonable under the statute, and there would be "reasonableness" in the trial court's finding. So, if that "unreasonable," because of something he did -- but I thought the Ninth Circuit had that question already. Why can't the same rule apply on the -- on the application of the time of trial judges? They can't say the time is unreasonable under the statute. But they may -- they may, nonetheless, find, that is unreasonable under the statute -- so long as they say that, under the Court's interpretation of the statute, that is unreasonable under the statute.
 But is it --
 Is this a correct answer?
 That the -- you could not do that, because the time was unreasonable?
 Yes, I -- that's correct. And --
 In other words -- not a time, but a statement, "I have a -- I have a theory that the time is unreasonable."
 Yes, that is correct. And --
 That is -- that is not the time. You have a statement. They say, "We have a time of 24 hours, but I don't think it's reasonable to assume there's more" -- and you could say the same thing -- "I have an alternate theory, so they have to impose their own time." That's what you have. That's what the argument is. And if that is, indeed, the case, isn't it -- is there any -- isn't there any standard more that would be applied to the difference between your theory, which is just, "We'll see, if there's a real difference;" and, "I have another theory here."
 The question has, at -- since Davis versus Arizona, whether we have that kind of an issue in the -- in this Court's rule. It hasn't. I'd have to say that it hasn't, although I haven't argued it here because I haven't seen it in that Court.
 Well, it has --
 And I --
 -- I would have to --
 I --
 I'd have to --
 Well, don't you have to argue Davis? (Laughter.)
 -- I'd have to argue Davis you'd have to argue Davis you'd have to argue Davis even if it's -- is true it -- Davis does come down to time. And so, it comes in as a -- excuse me -- Davis does come -- Davis. But Davis came down to time. Now, I -- you may -- it may come up as a kind of a litmus test. But it comes in with a statement that the time is unreasonable, and that's what you come to time with. And that's what you have to come right back with to get, no matter what. So, they say there's another theory, that's --
 Yeah, they say, "I have another one."
 And the Court said "otherwise."
 Right. They say --
 All right.
 -- they say "otherwise;"
 Okay.
 Right.
 But, on this one, they haven't. "Otherwise." But don't they -- aren't -- aren't they going back to the same time that the one time was unreasonable?
 No, they haven't, Your Honor. Nor did they say "time" or anything.
 Because they didn't say anything.
 Oh, no.
 No, they didn't say anything.
 What their theory is is -- it's -- the -- he is -- they are on the point that he started out on, and, over time, he got tired. And their answer is, it's perfectly alright to make a different one when he still has the one. You could say, "I would like -- "
 Where we're talking about something.
 Yes. Correct.
 And he said "no?"
 Yes. Correct.
 Because he said "no." And they say, "We have another one, which is not that time. And, you know, and we have another one, which is not that time. And, on the way, we're going back to the one that's not there." They've got one
