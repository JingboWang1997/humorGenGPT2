======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 once a motion is filed, the trial judge would review whether or not there had been prejudice.
 That's true, but the trial judge was not supposed to have the obligation on this side. You can argue about the timing of the -- you can argue about the timing of the filing of the -- but at the end of the day, it is the party who has this burden and the party who has the responsibility to file the complaint who's the one who's entitled to have the burden of proving a claim to be timely filed. But --
 Yes, but if you put -- and I'm not a lawyer -- if you put the burden on the -- if you put the burden on the trial court on this issue, it's easier for them to make a claim of prejudice. And -- and the fact was, the trial court found there was prejudice, and there was something close to a showing. It -- and that -- it says it was prejudiced. And therefore, the burden is on the respondent.
 Well, as in the first round of the Federal circuit, the district judge had two options. He could give the -- the defendant a presumption that would be contrary to subsection (3), which is a very different thing from the Federal court rule that we're seeking here. He could also send it back and say we have no question that we would find that there would be prejudice, to which the jury could return a negative verdict. But the problem is as we said, there is nothing, in terms of the fact whether the jurors in this case got the -- it's not what the trial court did, and certainly there is nothing in the record. The only question is that the jury is reasonably supposed to find it is prejudiced, but the jury is not reasonably supposed to find that the prejudice, when taken to the extent that the juror -- and this is in line -- the claim may be harmless. And here it appears, as in other cases where a jury does find that the evidence was insufficient, the defendant is forced into an expense claim in the Federal Circuit that it's difficult to -- to make at all. I say that the burden is on the -- on the defendant because -- because the burden of persuasion is with the defendant. That is a -- a requirement that the jurors must meet in order to find the claim to be timely filed. But the fact that those jurors -- you had the jury in this case who weren't qualified to find a claim. You said in this case there were three qualified jurors, but the jury -- the jurors in this case weren't qualified at all. I say it's because the court has said on the record it couldn't find, and it's been very clear to me since the claim was initially filed, there is a very clear difference in the circumstances in this case --
 That -- that's not the -- that's not the issue if we look at this -- is it an issue if we look at the claim as it was originally filed?
 Well, the claim remains that the -- the -- the jury was improperly selected and dismissed. That is to say this -- this evidence that the jury did not sufficiently meet the requirements of section 2271(1)(c) is not -- is not in dispute. That issue remains unresolved.
 What is the burden as -- as to determining that there's insufficient evidence?
 They don't -- there's no -- if the State court decided that this evidence was insufficient, it would be subject to challenges under section 2272. You'd have the -- then the State bar would have an opportunity to raise the issue. And that --
 Right.
 -- and that's where the statute is silent as to where to look for exceptions. I think under the State constitution, there would be no -- there wouldn't be any exceptions to the -- for the exclusion of some evidence simply because it was -- there was a claim that had been made.
 But would be subject to challenges. If the -- under the State constitution, in the State court, you're not making such a challenge. You're going to be given a challenge based upon an unexhausted State court case.
 But the fact is that there is an -- they have made a claim -- they have made a constitutional challenge to this case.
 Well, the -- the State court made the claim on both grounds -- claim to have been prejudiced and they -- at that time it was not unreasonable that they made that claim. But we --
 So we might have to start on that as well.
 I would -- I would -- I would say that if -- if the -- if the State court -- the question then was did the judge make the --
 But the judge made no such claim, did the State court make any such claim of prejudice?
 The State court made a claim, but it doesn't follow. The -- if the State court had made that claim, obviously with the benefit of time, it probably would have been on the subject, but I do --
 But -- but the only question in the -- was
