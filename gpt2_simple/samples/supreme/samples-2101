 the States or the Federal Government. And the Government has recognized, it was at page 6(a) that the Secretary is saying that this is one -- this is a Federal law. It can be a law enforced by the Federal Government or by the States. And that was one of the arguments to the effect of that the Secretary has adopted. It's not clear, as -- as this Court has acknowledged, that it means the one-year limitation imposed by this Court.
 But, Mr. Stewart --
 Yes.
 -- would you -- would you support, as is done elsewhere --
 Yes.
 -- the -- you have to pay a tax in every State of the Union. Then you say -- then you say, okay, so I have a limited number of States that do charge a tax. And then you have to pay -- and -- and then the next question you have to pay is whether you comply with the Federal tax.
 Absolutely.
 Okay. And you said: Yes, I can give you a number of -- I can give you a number that gives you a tax that's going to go somewhere, whether you comply or not. That's just -- that's just simply not --
 But on your reading, the -- the distinction you're making is that this money, as it is --
 I think it goes -- it's just one piece of money.
 I'm -- I'm assuming that you have $10 billion worth of this.
 Okay.
 And -- and -- what we're really looking at here, as I understand the arguments, is you ask the State of Maryland, which has a $30 billion debt, to take away $30 billion, to say, look, we've taken away $30 billion and we can do it over, okay? Okay? Just take that away. Then if you're not going to allow us to do it over, no, that isn't what the Secretary said. It said, no, we can deal with you over $50 billion, and, if you allow us to do it over, OK, so long as you comply with that. And what I'm -- I'm asking you, I think, is whether that's what the Secretary meant by this statute. And if it isn't, can I get a clarification that you should take the first $50 billion away?
 Your Honor, it was $10 billion. It was the principal amount at the time the petition was taken it. What we're saying is --
 Yeah.
 -- we have three problems with your interpretation of this statute.
 Well, I -- I don't know if $10 billion is the correct threshold under the statute, but I understand that you can't just ask us to $10 billion, you have to get $15 billion to $50 billion, that's got to be $50 billion. That's got to be $80 billion, and you have to do it over a 15-year period of $80 billion. What I'm saying is, you have three problems with your interpretation of this statute. The first problem is, is that we're not allowing our courts to sort out what the Secretary meant by the statute. What the Secretary was saying this is a Federal tax that is enforced by this Federal court and only taken away for those States that comply, that -- that are doing it by the State. And to do so, by the State, you -- you must find compliance in the State, and the Secretary was saying --
 What we're talking about --
 -- we impose a particular liability on the State.
 -- what we're talking about here is the burden on the Federal court in deciding the case. If that burden is not reduced if you comply, where is that burden in the case we're talking about here?
 It is -- it is not reduced if you comply because the Secretary was saying you have to go to the State and find that there's a sufficient burden. You must find compliance in New Mexico.
 OK. So New Mexico is fine --
 And then you have to -- then you have to find compliance in Nevada, if you're doing it by the State.
 The Secretary was really --
 It's a State that -- that's got to pay the fine for its failure to pay its taxes.
 In the New Mexico case, the costs of the court proceeding goes up, in the other State. The -- you can't -- you can't simply ask for a $30 billion to $50 billion tax bill in New Mexico. That's not the burden you have to face. You have to deal with the State and you have to find compliance.
 That's exactly where the statute falls. And to put it that way, I -- I think it's very difficult to get a person who's going to be in a Federal court for 15 years in New Mexico, looking out a window and realizing that they've got the Government in New Mexico, the Federal Government, and then the Federal Government just comes in and says, we don't have the burden
