======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 you'll meet him.
 That's what it says and it's what I think, too. You don't look it up, you just remember how you were and how you felt at that time.
 They don't think I'm going to be any different now.
 That doesn't seem to be true. Maybe you're different now, but you haven't changed. So how do you feel about him?
 You know, maybe you don't go for this kind of guy. Maybe you're just too busy being careful.
 The next one wasn't what you hoped for.  I just have to put up with it and not waste any more time.
 I'm okay with that.
 How are you today?
 Oh, you're not kidding? Are you serious?
 No, I'm not.
 Can't you stop that?
 You were, didn't you?
 Well?
 Don't laugh.
 My brother and I are going to have dinner tonight.
 Well, that's a great idea.
 No, it's fine. Good luck. 
 I need my phone number.
 Of course.
 You're not coming out of any sort of financial crisis, are you?
 I'm sorry, of course not.
 Do you mind if I ask about the past?
 Oh, and that?
 I'm trying to sleep.
 Do you want me to come down here, or not?
 I'm not going to have dinner because it might be an inconvenience.  Why should I get up early to have dinner with a girl with an accent?
 No.
 Well, do you still like guys a little bit?
 My brother said that you were "really not in that girl category."
 Well, a little bit.
 You mean, when we were in high school, I saw the picture of you, didn't I?
 Well, let's just say that I did.
 I think we're going to start this here. We did quite well.  Do you have a new boy, if you like?
 Of course, yes.
 And your brother told you that I was not a liar.  No, there's nothing to be embarrassed about.
 But, why were you doing that?
 You're the most honest girl I've had the pleasure of meeting.
 Sure you did, wouldn't you?
 He was one of those guys, too.
 My brother said that.
 Of course.
 And he told you that he liked you.
 Yes, I did.
 Don't ask me.
 I'm sorry, how come you're not coming to church with me for dinner?  I hope the two of you do something about it.
 I'm glad I had to explain it to you.
 You'll never know how nice and gentle and kind you look. I'm going to have to get that over with.
 I'd really like to hang out.
 I was just in the parking lot, and he said, you know, "What are you doing here with all this other stuff?"
 A guy told me that you were a friend of his.
 Hi.
 I had to, for our church, to go to the church.
 My brother and I are going to host a dinner tonight.
 No, how about that.
 I'm a big fan of the whole "The way of the knife."
 I don't think that's a very good thing to be saying?
 This guy told me something too.
 Of course you wouldn't.
 Maybe I should. 
 You don't have to answer back. You have a lot more experience than that, do you?
 I'm sorry.
 Why are you doing it?
 If I were here I might just say that they can feel you, too.  Maybe it's because I have the feeling.
 It wouldn't be a problem.
 It's fine.
 Of course.
 I mean, I'm not looking for trouble.  You're not into trouble.
 I just thought I should get you out of that.
 And, if you asked for help, I'd be right here, too. Right away.
 I see.
 I'd be right away.
 I was wondering just a minute, what do you think?
 Well that.
 And if I had a moment?
 No, they're not going to run away.
 I just wanted to let you, you know...
 I don't know.
 Is it because you're in love with her?
 It's not the case.
 I just thought I'd leave it out a couple of minutes.  I think I'd...
 I just thought you'd...
 I'm sorry, I guess I did.
 I was, too.
 You're not, is that it? Is this like that? It's so... this, too. And all of the sudden you'll be on your knees holding a
