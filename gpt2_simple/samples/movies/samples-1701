 always knowin' what he does out there.
 ...I want to know.
 You've been to some hell-hole hellhole before then?
 ...I don't know...
 ...What the hell happened?
 ...You mean this guy just got his ass busted?
 ...What's the real name?
 I just wanted to get your side of it...
 The hell have you done before?
 ...You know, 'cause I know this place. I know there's not one dime I haven't been to.
 You told me you weren't there before?
 I don't need no'n tell ya what happened to me there. I don't need no'n anything but the good ol' good old days...and the good ol' days are long gone and you don't need no'n any money in there to get 'er to you.
 We ain't gone anywhere. What we gonna get into here is gonna make you a suspect for what you already know the best. You gonna need a car before we take you on and a place to stay before we take you off and I'll need a place to stay...the place you're going into is called 'The Center And Outdoors and that's where it starts, the center' and he says we're all set there with this guy and what we gotta do is find his wife. You gotta find that woman to tell me who's been in there before.
 I do...
 ...You don't understand.
 ...Who you supposed to say to me?
 ...You gotta find me the woman...
 I don't...I don't...
 ...What?
 ...You know it's not enough. You got to do your own investigation.
 ...This girl's got to do her own investigation...
 ...And then you're gonna keep me there and I'm gonna put you over there.
 ...And then you're gonna tell me how much this girl's gonna pay?
 ...Well I'm telling ya.
 We're waiting 'till we get to that place. How's the progress on the investigation?
 We get to that place, they've got no way out of here except for going to the corner.
 ...You wanna know what that ain't?
 ...That's right.
 'We could just as easily kill me now...
 ...You got to think.
 Then we can never go inside there.
 ...You gotta think.
 We all need to think about it...
 Why don't we just do it...
 What you call it?
 ...When we get inside there we get inside the motel...
 ...I'm here...What are you waiting for?
 Well, I like him.
 ...They're gonna kill me.
 ...You gotta kill me!
 ...What are you doing here?
 ...I have to go.
 ...What's the hurry?
 ...That's right...
 They'll keep it in the hotel room. They keep it in an apartment on Elm Street.
 Right.
 ...No place to sleep...
 ...They're gonna be in a car...
 ...I need you to get me out of there.
 I could always think of something.
 You got time to think.
 Oh...
 It can be done.
 ...Yes...
 Yeah...
 ...How did we get in there?
 ...But, yes...It's...It'll take an hour to go over the way we got in...
 ...We can't get all the way in...
 ...I couldn't find my key...I had forgotten it...I was going to the lobby...I came back, I ran over I think I saw the place...
 ...Yeah...
 ...We can go to this place and take out this guy...
 ...What the hell the hell is it?
 ...I think he's got someplace to stay... I don't know where...
 ...I'm gonna kill you.
 ...Yeah...
 ...Okay then...what do we do next?
 ...I'm gonna hit him.
 ...If I ever see him again, I might see the light of day...
 ...I hate to say this but...I don't like what the man is doing here and I don't like what we're doing here...
 ...So I think I'm going to have to kill 'em for this.
 ...I don't like this man...
 ...Why don't you go ahead and kill `em.
 ...How much do they know about this place?
 ...They know I'm here...This is my sister...I don't know what I'm doing here...it's just a plain old stupid question...I ain't going to answer that...
 ...They know where we lived before?
 ...You got to get past here before I can talk about it...there's a million different reasons why you got to get past here...
 You know it's a big place
