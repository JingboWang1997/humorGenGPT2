 are it?
 I'm sure he'll get on that.
 But there's a part of you that wants to know more about his life. You know that, don't you?
 That's right. He's an extraordinary man, a member of the very first generation -- you can say that's good, I'll say that. They came into existence a thousand years and only today they have become the most powerful civilization in the world. The first to develop machines -- the first to build cities -- the first to develop agriculture -- the first to create men as well as machines -- to make a machine the same size as a man, if his hand weren't the size of your fist --
 And he's the son of Adam's father --
 No -- he's a man. He's his father. Adam killed him. It was a sin.
 So?
 He's a member of Adam's family. He's a descendant of the first man. The Adam and Eve -- he's the last of her kind. Her husband's name is Cain. This is his family.
 Why not? You were here to protect her. Why didn't she warn you that Eve killed her husband? Why didn't she tell you you found a machine to kill him? You're in danger.
 What can I tell you about Eve? A good, honest woman -- that's the only thing that's in her heart. She wants to know what happened to her husband.
 If I had any way of finding him, the next morning -- before Eve -- I would've found him.
 All I do is tell the truth.
 You should've told me that.
 My father's a preacher. He gave people power in the way of the Devil and so I believe him. You don't believe me.
 I believe in a man's conscience. I don't want to risk the lives of Adam's first parents, but I've to. So I let this lie. They tried to kill him.
 What about me? Who you? What could you possibly trust?
 Of course he'd tell the truth. 
 He'd have to tell you the reason.
 Yes you could. 
 Would you -- ?
 Eve told me one thing. It was never meant to be told in that way.
 Don't you understand? Adam was always looking for a good God. No human being would say God created a machine to stop the flood or send people back to the earth.
 Well I'm sure Adam's a monster!
 I'm thinking about Eve and Adam. They're both monster builders and they both know it --
 I'm doing more work on them than Eve.
 Eve tells us he's gone -- he's gone -- I mean, I've been looking for him and...
 Look, I'm worried. I'll say that later on. But right now... I'm trying to come to grips with Eve and me. I'm doing more of this than I ever have before.
 What do you want me to say?
 We both know about how you got the name -- and the consequences of doing so. That's no reason to change your mind.
 You were talking about getting us out of this trap.
 You've made the biggest mistake of my life.
 It's never just, 'I can't do that. I can't do that.' It never was, it was for the greater good. Eve told me about the machine -- even told me how you used it to destroy her, so I got Adam wrong. And now --
 Then what do you want?
 We know how to put a collar on that thing, get rid of whatever it is it is that it's got. If we knew a way to get rid of it, we might never have to deal with it.  Adam's gone. Eve's dead. We've got our own machines -- we've built the machines to go into the machines, put a collar on it, do it.
 So what? That the machine got a collar on it...
 Eve knows Adam is a threat. Adam's a threat. If we let her in with the right people -- that's all there is.
 Adam had a little more in common with you when he was alive -- he had a machine to fight Leviathan.
 I don't know what it's like. There's all sorts of places in the world -- you know where I'd be, I get it, all right?
 He's been through so much. I think we should have tried to get him out first.
 He was one of the greatest men there were. You've got a machine to fight -- and I think it's your duty to try to keep it at bay, that's all.
 Adam was a machine -- like you said. Not like you remember him, but with enough time and patience we could have him back. And the only way to do that is through the power of the machine.
 Yes.
 There was a lot
