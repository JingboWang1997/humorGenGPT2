======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Falcon: What's the problem?
 Yes.
 I can see it in your eyes, Jack.
 What about your feelings?
 You've been wrong about three more times.  Your own good.
 You're sure you don't want to go with me?
 It's me or you, you know.  I could help you find the others, but I wouldn't need their help. You'd have to think about it over for yourself.
 I don't believe you.
 The people who are in need.
 My own feelings are the problem.  I have no feelings at all about you.  I have no feelings at all about us.
 If I said you were in love with me, I might say, "I understand."
 It's too late.
 I know.
 I know.
 I'd feel even if I had a different name.  I've already met one.  I don't want to be your only friend anymore.
 No.
 They say it's the feeling of being loved.
 I'm sure.
 I haven't met anyone who would understand me like that. And neither have the strangers who make me feel like shit. I guess I've been trying to get over that since my first semester.
 How are you?
 The day the other started, I made up my mind to keep going.  I have never said I wasn't a workaholic.
 It's the same day as your first night.
 I want to see my old friends.
 We do so much together.  We are different like different types of people.  I want to see my old friends.
 Can I give you some more time?
 You should.
 What?  I'm not the one for a little adventure.
 Can I help?
 Jack.  I want to do something for you.
 I want to go.
 I think you are going to make it back.
 I haven't seen them for ten years.
 I know why they died, Jack.
 You killed them?
 Well, that's one way of saying no.
 I never said one thing until my first night there.
 You're lying.
 Maybe I am.
 I think it's too late.
 A little while.
 We can have everything.  I want to go down and see what you do now.
 A lot.
 My mother's in California.
 Where I stay.
 What?
 I got a boyfriend out in LA, but that's it.  If I stay here, I'll never have any luck with this.
 So you can stay right here?
 I'm not going.  Where's my hotel?
 You've been with your boyfriend, right?
 You can't do that?
 I can't leave here.  I have no reason not to.
 We will, we will.  I'm going with you.
 I still love you.
 No, I've already got everything.
 But your mom said you still had to leave.
 What's she gonna do?
 It's all about you now.
 I don't think it hurts.
 It hurts.
 It's okay, it's okay.
 No, I'm fine.
 We're going to be OK.
 Jack, please don't hurt me.
 Well, I've been thinking I'm in love.
 I've wanted you since I was five.  All my life.
 Oh, Jack.  I didn't mean it to scare you.  I'm very sorry.
 Jack.  Jack, we are so close.
 I'm sorry.
 Jack.  No, no, it's not, I love you too.
 You're beautiful.
 Look why you're all messed up.
 I love you and I just want you to know.
 And my mom... She loved me.
 She's not happy.
 I love you, honey.
 Well, I don't want to.
 I love you too.
 Oh, I see.
 I love you too.
 Honey.  I love you.
 Daddy told me...
 Did it hurt?  No, it's just...
 Hi!
 My parents love you.
 So, honey.
 Yeah!
 I think you're right!  I mean, I'm not in love...
 Daddy and I, we were in love before we were married, my brothers...
 I have to go.
 Yes.  I'm.
 Is this where you are?
 No.  I can't.  So I love Daddy...
 Is there something you want to talk to me about?
 Are you here to tell me about your parents?
 You've been watching you around every day.
 Hi.
 Hi.
 Hi.
 Is there something I can do for you?
 Hello?
 Yeah, it will. I've only said it once, and
