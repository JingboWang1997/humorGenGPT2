======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Hello!
 It's still too early to tell where exactly it was. We're checking in on it every now and again.
 That's okay.
 Sorry!
 It's okay to be a little nervous. We'll see what we can do.
 This is a weird place. If I can't sleep in my room with this place open, don't I suppose I could sleep somewhere else?
 You'll remember me.
 I know. That was a tough choice...
 You know what? I don't know who to trust.
 Well, I feel safe in this house.
 You have?
 I don't know. I'm afraid. I mean that, I don't trust anyone and I don't think everyone that you might think that I should think so...
 I don't like to talk about it.
 My brother's been telling me that we can't take this place.  That the only reason he doesn't get us out is because he thinks we're going to kill him. That it's the only reason he doesn't get you out.
 You know what? I don't know.
 We can't take it from you.
 What can you do?
 The next morning the next day I think I'll tell you that I heard him.  I don't know where I heard him.  I don't know if I believe it. All I know is that I heard him somewhere on the line...
 I don't think it's a question of belief anymore.
 They're just as if my life depended on it.  They're as if I could change it all.
 Do you think, Max, that I believe what you're saying... that there is a God... that I've got a mission to accomplish, to do good, and that, at the end of the day, if it is all that, I'll never see you again?
 That's not the way to answer your question, Max...
 This is a question I'd like to ask you.  How do you feel?
 What do you mean?
 There's something I want you to know about before this goes any further.  I don't know what it is.  I only know that it's not going to make the news any more than I already know.
 I don't believe it and that's all.
 The people you said I couldn't kill are people I know.
 What are you talking about?
 It's not a question of belief anymore; it's a question of how I think.
 To you?
 To me, I would like to know about your belief.  To me. How do you think?  Do you think... that there is a God? That I can make the world a better place?
 No, you could. You could have been.
 I don't like being told what I don't know.
 This is not a question of belief anymore.
 I'm not a skeptic.  I don't believe it.
 What... a skeptic?
 No, but I don't know why you're saying that.
 I need your advice.
 That's not what you're saying.  I never even thought of that.  I've been told for years that you're a believer by people who have been saying this in public all day long.
 I'm saying that this is not a question of belief anymore.  It doesn't matter if I'm wrong or whether I'm right.
 I didn't tell you.
 Oh, Max.
 This isn't a question of belief anymore.
 I don't think you need a reason.
 How do you think I feel?
 That's right.
 I don't know what to tell you.  Please...
 I said I was afraid.
 Maxie, no.  We haven't met.
 No, you didn't answer my question.  You said that.
 I mean I'm not sure.
 You're wrong.  What are you saying?
 What?
 Why?  What do you mean?
 No, I'm sorry.
 I think you might be right.  Listen, we have to.  You know I'm trying to help you and I know you like to be helpful but what if I don't mean I'm trying to help you?
 ... You're asking me to think about... what are you asking me to think?
 You can do that.
 I'm not saying that.
 Of course not!  It can't be!  Don't call me a liar again.  Come on.  I'm trying to help you.  It's what I've been told as I sit here.  You know the one?  The one that says I have a gift.  A power I don't even know how to use.  And the one that has a mirror in it.  A mirror that can... can actually reflect the way that I think.  There
