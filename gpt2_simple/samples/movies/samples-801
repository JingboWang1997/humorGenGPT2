======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Yeah, that's good news.
 Do it with good will. 
 I have so much to say to the children. I've lost my children.  We're all supposed to be so happy...
 Tell the kids.  We're so lucky to have these things.  Tell them a story and give them hope.
 What did that man want?
 Not in my opinion, but I've seen your name every day since college.
 I was at the office today for dinner. I met you.  I was with you.  I was really proud of you.
 Yes.
 You're going to be great.
 I really like you.
 What about it?
 I'll think about that.  I'm sorry I called at six.  The kids got excited and I have to think about them.
 Maybe I could call up the kids and put them through some homework. We all need to do some homework.
 I was thinking the same thing.  The kids need some help.  The family's gone through a rough patch.  It's like the family.  They're all still doing well. But the kids are struggling a little. The whole thing is a little dramatic.
 So did I.
 You know, I didn't mean to sound like I'm right or dumb, did I? I'm doing okay.  But I got it wrong, and now it's the other way around.  It was, like, I was just about to tell a funny story or something and it just stopped...
 How can anything be funny.
 I guess so.
 Can I call you when I'm getting ready to call it?
 You're right... I should call you.
 My father was going to take me with him to San Francisco and I just got to be away from them.
 Hi! Oh... I'm sorry... I didn't mean to get into that.
 Did you see it?
 I remember you, when I was five or something.
 Yeah.
 Did you ever know what you were talking about?
 You remember it?
 I don't want to go and do any of this shit.
 You did.  I thought you saw it on TV, didn't you? 
 Well, I think we're gonna stay here.
 I can't hear you, you moron.
 Hey, don't knock 'em.  What's your name?
 Look, maybe you shouldn't.  You want to do it with me. We're gonna do a big thing with that family.  We'll get you jobs.  We'll get you some sort of public relations thing, like...
 That isn't correct.
 I can't hear you.  Why do it.
 It's a big story, isn't it?
 That's right.  Let me tell you... I was thinking about my name.
 Did you see that piece of news that ran in the paper? I don't know.
 Yeah.
 Is that your favorite?
 I didn't get this for your birthday.  I figured I'd share.
 I didn't get it.
 Did you get the paper when I showed it to you?
 You should call me.
 I don't know.  I have a new name.  You should come. You're my friend.  Can we chat a little?
 Can you see my picture?
 I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done it.  I apologize.
 It looks pretty good on me.
 He looks pretty good.
 I just took my clothes off. You know, I was pretty surprised to see my name on the face of a man with a baby face all over his face.
 Hey, it wasn't that hard.
 I'll buy your jacket.
 He said he liked you?  Why?
 Let him.  I've got a very nice jacket for you.
 You don't want to see him.
 I'm sorry.
 You remember me, huh?  What do you want?
 Yes.  Do it.
 How many days was it?
 Look, I was... I was really going to make you a deal with it.  That's pretty good of you.
 You like my work.
 I'm not here to talk about that.  I just want to talk... about you.
 I got you a new job today.
 I like your work.
 How 'bout you, Mr. Felt.
 You look great in your tie.
 You want me to sit down?
 What have I got?
 You want me to go to the theater or do something else?
 Oh.
 Yeah.
 Sure.  That's fine.
 Are they going?  I got some other shows tonight.
 Not bad for a two-year- old.
 Oh.
 Did you get it for this one?
 Yeah.
 Did I get it?
