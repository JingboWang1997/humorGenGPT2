et for two men to go off for half a day and a woman to keep an eye on the boys.


 But, I don't think that.

 No, don't worry. I'm not going to.
 Who? Why?

 I don't know, I'll stay.
 And no.


 I think it's for you.
 A, but you could be doing a little, for a girl like you. They're getting you and they're not getting me.
 Don't forget who's in charge if our little group's a hit.
 Yeah, so. But I don't know.
 Don't you think you could use a little more encouragement.
 Hey, what do you think the group's gonna be called?
 The Group, the L, and The Group. A. The Group, a. Group, b. The Group, c. The Group.
 Sounds simple, right?
 It's a good thing I was in the group.
 I just found out. I don't think I could've gotten out of the group.
 Hey, where'd you get an invitation?
 They're probably trying to make you stay, which is sad, but it's not like they have to.
 I was a part of the group last time and I did some very dumb things, but I didn't think it was going to get you or me that far.
 How about me?
 I'm sorry, she's one hundred and seventy and three hundred and three- and seventy-eight and one hundred and seven- and eighty- and a hundred and sixty- and I'm going to make fifty-and- twenty- and one hundred and seventy-seventy-and seven- and eighty-seventy-nine-and- I'm going to make eighty-and-one- and a hundred and nineteen- and four-and a hundred and twenty- and a hundred and seventeen and a hundred-seventy-seven-and- a hundred-eight-and- a hundred-seven-and and a hundred-seventy-seven- and a hundred-seventy-seven-and a hundred-seventy-seven-and a hundred-and-eight-and- a hundred-and-seven-and- a hundred-and-seventy-seven-and- a hundred-and-seven-and-a-ten-and a-seventyo. You wanna come in? I'm in the Group.


 She's in the Group.
 No, she's not.
 She's a member of the group you talked about. And I don't want to be part of any other group. You go in... she says, "I'm not part of any other group." But I don't want to see her. I want to be part of a group and I want to be in your group.
 It's for you. I can't let you take me out. I wanna be together with you, you know, and you can't take me out.
 No! I mean, we have some big plans. I don't want to see you. Not without her. So get out of me!

 You know where he took out some girl like that. He said, "We want some girl like this." What kind of girl?
 I don't want to see her.
 No! I don't want to see her. I don't wanna see her. She won't be in my group.
 What does he expect me to do?
 You know, just because he has a guy in the group I don't get out of it. You want me to be a part of the group? Not for you. You'd see them as an enemy. You'd be better off just not doing it, right?
 Look, I'll tell him I'm not here.
 If he gets out, I'm just not gonna see him.

 He'll go after me?
 Don't worry. I won't be at the party.
 I think I'll have to do that.
 What do you think you could do for me?
 There will be a little thing there. I'll ask for one. Maybe I'll ask the boss to give you a special car. I'll give you a special car.
 Let me see what it says. "For one week in the clubroom each week. Don't be in another group. No boys in the group."
 But...
 Yeah, right now!
 If I go to dinner, go to the bar.
 I'll have to have a little thing in my group.
 Okay, I'll take a couple of girls too.
 Hey, what don't you think I'd do with you, if there were any boys?
 There's a little thing that she told me about. A girl just told me that. And you know what? I'll always feel like I'm with
