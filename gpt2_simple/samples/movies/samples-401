======== SAMPLE 1 ========
.  You and your momma are on a mission here to prove to everyone "We're a good little squad, we're going to do it," the way we got you, not to get anything for nothing, we're just going to get you, so you get no one to blame. You should've left, I thought. You should've kept your mouth shut.  You should've been punished. Nobody knew you'd do something like that.  Why did you do it, then, I wonder, come to me?  A kid gets on the bus. You, that girl, you got a life. You got an identity. You got a personality. They've taught me that.  I didn't grow up in some country town--everywhere they go, they bring something nice--that would get people's attention.  Every guy I know will tell me he gets in and goes home and gets on that bus.
 I wonder who he has.
 You must be mistaken!  Why don't you just keep looking?  Look.  He's a good man, you know.  He's a good man.  I think he's a good man.
 What do you think about it?
 I wish.  I wish.  That's the worst thing.  It is not good.  It is not good.  We can't wait for a year like this.  Our friends are all going.  This country is heading for a very slow death.
 What are you saying?  I don't believe you.  We can't wait.  The truth is, my Lord, the truth.  We've been through a lot of tests here.  We've been through hell and back, and I don't think you believe your Lord is waiting for you.  So you must have faith in the Lord.
 You have no faith.  You don't believe in anything, and then you don't believe in God.
 I don't believe he waits for anyone.  He waits for himself.  He waits for you, and you wait for him.  You have faith in the Lord.  You have faith in the Lord.  You have faith in the Lord.  You have faith in the Lord.  You should feel at peace.  I have faith in the Lord.  I believe you're a Christian.  You should feel at peace with yourself.
 All right.  Yes, I'll leave the house and follow you.  But I have heard enough and I've gone, so now is a good time to go away.  I should be content being a servant.  I should be content being a servant.  But we have no choice.  We have no choice.  This Lord is a poor one--He needs a good servant.
 I should like to give this my love to you.
 Thank you again, my dear, but I'd rather serve you in your office or in the house. It's time to go...
 That's not my question.  That's my question.  You've been serving me at my apartment all this.  I think I'm going to have to change, if I am to find peace when a better place awaits.  I would certainly wish to work in your garden.  To be a good housemaid.  And for that I'm thinking the garden is the best garden.  If you like, be able to spend as much time as you like...  And as a housemaid you will have a lot of room from which to look out for a lot of garden variety.  Your housemaid will have a room from which to look out for a lot of garden variety--but you do not find the garden, my dear, you do not find this garden.  That garden is the best garden.  It doesn't have the same qualities.Â  You want to look for it but there is not a garden.  You have a lot of room from which to look out for a lot of garden variety.  You had a good time with that garden, my dear, but there is not a garden.  My garden has a lot of room for you--but only a good garden is happy.  That is the place.  You find that garden.  That is where you are.  I am happy here.  A garden which I am happy to live in.  A garden which I am happy to live in--in a garden which I am happy to live in.  I have a garden which I am happy to dwell there... but I do not find this garden.  No garden.  No garden... no garden.  I have a garden.  I have a garden.  You have a garden in your backyard.  What a wonderful garden you have... for the people who want a lot of gardens, but I am not sure of that.  That is the way of things.  Things are better now, if I could come to you.
