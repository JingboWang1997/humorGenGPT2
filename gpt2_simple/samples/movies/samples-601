?
 I never had an idea.
 Well, then...I hope you don't think I'm like you, Mr. Wahlhausen.
 Well, I don't know...
 You don't know I?
 It's a very good idea, my dear; I am sure of that.
 That's exactly the point. Your mother wasn't. We were together all our life, and yet you and I, we're going to lose...
 So if you could talk to my mother and tell her we'd be well together, that I wouldn't want to come to that wedding.
 Why?
 I never said this before.
 Your mother is not at the wedding.
 What you say? I don't say that anymore.
 Oh, I'm sure you have. Why did you say that?
 My mother would kill to tell me. She'd never allow me to marry a man. She couldn't.
 Would she?
 Yes.
 Mrs. Lachmann and I had a wonderful time.
 Mrs. Hirsch!
 Mrs. Lachmann?
 Mrs. Lachmann, I'm so glad you could join me, Mrs. Haider.
 Oh, Mrs. Wahlhausen, Mrs. Lachmann had a lovely dinner last evening.  How was it?
 I'd like you to look through the glass, Mrs. Haider. You can see all those wonderful things, Mrs. Lachmann. Your mother can't find this room.
 It's only the two of us.
 Mrs. Wahlhausen!
 It's only the two of us...
 Mrs. Haider said it may have been a woman.
 Mrs. Lachmann, it was a woman.
 I never said it was.
 A woman.
 Mrs. Lachmann said, Mrs. Haider, I'm leaving for a very important woman.
 Mrs. Lachmann said she was leaving the room.
 What are you doing?
 Mrs. Lachmann...Mrs. Lachmann...Mrs. Lachmann...Mrs. Lachmann...Mrs. Lachmann...Mrs. Lachmann...Mr. Wahlhausen...Mrs. Wahlhausen...Mrs. Wahlhausen...Mrs. Lachmannâ€¦Mrs. Wahlhausen...Mrs. Lachmann...Mrs. Wahlhausen...Mrs. Lachmann....Mrs. Haider. I think I will go too quickly into her company, Miss Haider.
 Mrs. Haider told me she would love him!
 If we did, she would send him to live with us. She wouldn't. A man like that can't live with me. He can have me all around him. A man like that can't live with me anymore. Miss Haider, I've got a man like that waiting for me in America. He'll kill me.
 Mr. Wahlhausen would kill you.
 Mrs. Lachmann couldn't tell what Mr. Lachmann would tell her.
 Mrs. Haider couldn't have been more right, Mrs... Mrs ... Mrs. Haider. I wish I were your friend. I could see Mrs. Haider all around us. I would know what she'd say. I wish I knew what Mr. Wahlhausen would say.
 Mr. Haider won't ever tell me what he would tell Mrs. Haider. He won't ever tell me what Mrs. Haider said at dinner.
 Mrs. Haider told me, Mrs... Mrs. Haider.
 Mrs. Lachmann, why are you looking at me like that, Mr. Haider?
 Mrs. Lachmann's a very beautiful woman.
 I wouldn't tell a dirty lie to her, Mrs. Lachmann...
 Oh, Mr. Haider, you don't have a good heart! Mrs. Haider, she will never lie to you.
 Mrs. Haider wouldn't believe me. It was Mrs. Lachmann....Mrs. Haider...Mrs. Lachmann...Mrs. Lachmann...Mrs. Lachmann...Mrs. Lachmann... Mrs. Lachmann...Mrs. Lachmann.
 Mrs. Haider said it wasn't really a dirty lie. And what was Mrs. Haider saying, Mrs... Mrs. Lachmann?
 Mrs. Haider said... Mrs. Haider... Mrs. Lachmann. Mrs. Lachmann... Mrs. Lachmann... Mrs. Lachmann.
 Mrs. Lachmann?
 You're not going to be the first one to admit it. Mrs. Haider had a pretty face when she met you.
 Oh, you're not Mrs. Wahlhausen!
 Mrs. Haider said "Mrs. Haider?"
 Mrs. Haider. Mrs. Haider.
 My name is Mrs
