======== SAMPLE 1 ========
oo of yours are with that man?
 The man I love.
 How do I know?
 I think you did the best they could.
 Look out!
 Don't get too close to that thing... it can bite you.
 No, nothing.  Just... leave it alone... until I find him...
 So you really think he's got you.
 The thing.  The thing?  I can't find it.  It's gone.
 It's gone?
 What do you mean?
 It's gone! 
 Yes...
 They're right...  You have the one piece you want... the piece you need.
 They're right.
 No.  I don't want to die alone.  I want them all...
 ...But I want one piece.
 You were meant for us.  You must have it.
 I told you, right.  But... I know everything.
 You told me you want this piece, don't you?
 The most valuable possession in the universe for someone like me is a name...
 I know...
 All this stuff. You do. Everything.  You are a part of history.  It will be your legacy. But it all starts today.  Now. I am the greatest treasure of the human race - the only one who can save us all.
 I am not your friend!
 You must have it.
 If you've got it in your head, let it go.
 I can't do that, you must let me go.
 Can you take me?  Can we take your back to the other end of the galaxy?
 I think that might be your time.
 I should be in my ship.
 This time you've better be careful.  We've never had contact with the planet.
 That's right.  The Force won't be the only thing that matters here.  He'll be the only thing that matters.
 I know...
 You can tell from the Force.
 You're the greatest lightsaber, the Force.  When you reach out to touch someone, you can tell the truth.
 You were given the gift of the lightsaber to fight the war on your own.  You have the power, yes, the power, the power of a Jedi Master.
 Where do you get this?
 You should go back and get your lightsaber.
 I'm in the middle of a mission to avenge the death of my wife.
 What's this, Master?  Are you doing a promotion?
 I'll have to put her in the Jedi Temple on Ossus.  And then I'll come along. That should take care of it.
 She's probably dying in there.  Then she won't be here.
 Yes.
 She's not dead?
 I killed her.  I killed her with my lightsaber.
 Why?
 It works!  Now let me bring her back.
 I can't hold you here forever.
 Yes, now I can hold you back.
 I can hold you back.
 You can no hold her for long.
 Just hold her.
 All you can do is stay here...
 She's on her way back to the surface.
 Where?
 She's never come back.
 But you can't bring her back.  She'll never get there.
 You're still capable of it.  For now, I'm going to have to watch my back. If you want, you can bring me home.
 She'd make an excellent companion for you.
 She'll be here soon.
 You can bring her back now or you can go to the Jedi Temple on Ossus. You've got to come back home.
 We should all go home.
 And you believe it is impossible for me to do that?
 You're crazy.
 We're taking her home.
 Why?
 I don't know.  If you can't find someone else to take your daughter, I'll be your friend.
 Who'll take her?
 She's my daughter.
 This is where you went.
 This is where you went.
 I don't understand.  Where did that Jedi Master go?
 It'd be too much of a strain.
 I have many ways to take a family. Some of them don't work for me.
 You could not wait to see her again.
 Can I keep her?  Can I find some help?
 I know how it is...  I don't want you to think I'm going to leave you here, in that position.
 I hope to see you in the future.
 A Jedi's not one of them.
 I will never let you down, you should remember.
 You can never tell.  It happens.  I will be no more the Jedi Master than you, if I let it happen.
 I can't do it.
 You can never have more than two.
