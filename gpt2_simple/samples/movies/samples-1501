======== SAMPLE 1 ========
'll mean something on the house.  I'll tell all my men that, but until then, you stay home with the kids, and come when you want.
 I'm sorry. I'm afraid we can't go in on that.
 I'm sorry that you felt that way, but you really didn't want to go in the ambulance this morning.
 She's going home.  I'll be there tomorrow.
 I'm sorry. I thought we were going to talk about it.
 I have to talk to you, Mr. Mathers.  You're going to be in the ambulance when you go home.
 Oh, you do think that?
 We don't know what you did, Jack, but if that is to be trusted, we want to go as you go.
 I'm just afraid I don't think so.
 What are you going to do?
 We don't know what to do.  I have to go home.  I can't go down there with that kind of thing.  It's going to be so bad down here.
 What are you going to do, Jack?
 You didn't know anything.  You didn't even know what you were doing, because you never thought about it.  You did nothing!
 I don't know.  I got my own life. You didn't think of that, and you don't want anyone to hear about it.  I don't know what to do!  That's fine.  You got a lot of people to talk to!  What do you think of that? Are you kidding yourself?  You have a little trouble.  Have you tried drugs?
 Then what?  You didn't want to go in, did you?
 You knew better than to say anything, did you?
 You don't know what I told you yesterday, did you?
 I told you it would.
 I have to do something about that baby.
 I said I didn't think you were going to give them up.  If you'd just made a few bucks this year, it would be easy.
 That's right.
 I got them all right.
 This is Jack Mathers talking to you. They are his last ones.
 I've gotten my share out of them, it's good money.  You didn't have it, and I'm taking care of it.
 It must be nice.  How are you?
 I've been in the taxi business for forty years.  It ain't too old, either.  I don't remember the name of that business man you talked to, and I remember my own age and my own life.
 I don't understand, Jack.  Where are you?
 Don't get so upset.
 Oh.
 I'm sorry I'm late.  Do I have to get my coat?
 I'm late.
 Oh, yes, right, they were on the way.
 How the hell are you going to do a business, anyway?
 I thought I'd do some business, and take your coat.
 I didn't think so.
 What the hell did I do wrong?  I just wanted to see you.  And you showed up...  It's not any good.  I want you to know that I am sorry about what you did.
 I don't know.
 Why.
 It's me.  That's how it's going to be.
 You know that business man you talked to last night?  I have this business where I have a guy I don't know, a good guy, and I give him fifty bucks and he's on his way. And then I start looking for me, and he wants fifty dollars and he's still on his way. I'll bet the kid's very busy in that world. You remember.
 Why didn't it go away?
 I'm sorry, I didn't know.
 You're sorry?  It doesn't go away, it doesn't.
 You know.  I do it when I want to.  I go out for a good cause.
 When did you make your decision about how much to talk to me?
 That's why I just think I have to go back, but I guess I'll take another job.
 You think you just got me to come back and tell you you were right and I were wrong.
 What are you talking about, Jack?
 I'm talking about you, aren't I?
 Why isn't they going to leave you and your business there?
 Yeah, maybe that was just a coincidence.
 I think we have to take you back.
 Don't be alarmed.  I'm just here by myself, okay?
 I am not a very nice person.  I mean, you said I was ugly, and I'm sorry.
 I am very sorry, Jack.  Have you ever heard of your wife, Molly?
 I
