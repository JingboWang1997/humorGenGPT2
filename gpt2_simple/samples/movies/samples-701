======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 I took you inside
 What?
 You were wrong. I've come to give you up for this reason. You took your friend's life too close to home.
 I don't have much in this life, I didn't grow up in a big house.  The only thing I know is how to eat.
 Well you are on your own.  I've been paying attention to you a long time.
 No I thought I made a mistake in judgment, I guess I just don't know who I saw before.... You saw your best friend, I didn't... You saw my best friend, no I didn't --
 I mean, you should have seen your friend.
 Yeah I have. I know I have. I've been thinking about what I saw.
 You can see my friend.
 Where?
 I just want to see her.
 You don't have much in life, do you?
 Yeah. I've been thinking about it. And I'm sorry.
 Not too bad.
 I'll go see her.
 Why?
 The door is closed, Mr. L.
 Yes, it is. I just want to talk about you.
 Well, that's fine. And that's fine with you.
 I don't know you, so I don't really know, but I want to hear from you. Why?
 Yes you do.  Do you think you have any problems or anything?
 Yes.
 I'm sorry I interrupted that conversation. So you wouldn't have to tell me.
 That's what I was trying to do, wasn't it?
 Well, I'd do something for you if you would --
 My God this was horrible --
 I love you. You're my best friend.
 I love you.
 But this is not what you wanted to happen.  But we will go ahead with it.
 I'm not going to let you down.
 I know you're on your own, and you think I'm crazy. But there are a lot of people like you.
 I think I'm crazy.
 No.
 I'm not really that bad...
 No...
 I see your point.  I just wish all of you would take the time to see that movie.
 You must be getting a little carried away with the power and luck of luck.  You have a great reputation for giving your all.
 I don't know. I mean, I want to thank you for what you've done for me.
 Sure. But really, it's because I didn't know anyone like you when I met you. I don't really even like you very much.
 You haven't had many girlfriends.
 No.  I've never been one.
 You must be really lonely you are.
 My mother always told me never to come near men!  She just told me never to come near men.
 I... I didn't mean to offend you.
 I'm sure she has a fine house.
 You should come around and meet my mother.
 No.
 Is your mother really a very nice little lady?
 She knows how to cook.
 She was cooking. Who were her friends?
 There was a great deal of interest in her life. It must be an extremely hard life for her. But she makes you laugh with her. So do you, my dear. I should have known you before.  She is a very lovely girl.
 You really liked her mother too.
 I know that, but she's very bright.
 I know that.  But it's impossible to like a woman unless you like her.  I don't know why I do it.
 What do you mean, you think I'm a bad person?
 I didn't know that.  I didn't know that she loved her parents. I didn't know it at all.  I didn't even know she had children.
 You didn't know?  It seems like such a long time ago, and I'm just now discovering all the things I would have liked about them.  I never thought it would even come up.
 You... I like people like you. I think you don't love people like me....
 I love you.
 I love you.
 What do I love about you?  What about you?
 But....
 Look there.
 And...
 I'm sorry... but it does make us both a bit cold.
 No I--I'm just telling you I don't get out much.
 No.  I'm saying that I want to get away from you and your kind and my friends and... I... I wanna move away from you.
 What?
 Yes.  I wanna be very cold and very clear about it.
 Are you a cold and a clear, or do you get out a bit?
 Yeah that's right!  Did that stop you?
 Are you... Are you warm and clear?
