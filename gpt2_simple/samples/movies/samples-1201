======== SAMPLE 1 ========
  I don't know what you do.
 Oh. Well yeah, the best part was the big dance.
 Oh my God, I see you.
 You know, those guys have their lives so much more exciting than everybody else's.
 I'm serious. How would you guys have handled the situation?
 Oh, yeah? What kind of questions are they asked?
 I got a chance to ask you!
 You know, you're pretty special.
 Who asked you?
 Oh. Right. He's a very special friend of mine.
 His name's Kremers. It just popped up in a couple of these emails.
 You know, you are such a good listener --  
 You must be going somewhere.
 What?
 What are you talking about?
 You must be crazy.
 No, you must have gone to that place before.
 So, you saw it before before you did.
 You know, sometimes people just don't remember.
 You must think I'm crazy.
 I have to go now.
 He must have taken the right path.
 What's wrong?
 No.
 No.
 I don't know.
 I'm sure he's not going on a road trip.
 So, now they're really serious about the job.
 No.
 You don't look so comfortable being here, are you?
 I know a little about cars.
 If you're serious about this, I don't know if you're serious about this.
 Oh.
 I've seen him before. But I haven't seen him since I was a little girl. He drives cars.
 Oh. I... We're moving.
 We haven't seen anyone.
 Yeah, who else knows about it?  Well, you've got a name for the guy.
 So what're you asking me for?
 That's probably his name.
 There's a guy in my car.
 So what about that guy in the car...
 You're not crazy.
 If your name's Kremers, you're really an idiot.
 Why do they ask me?
 You're not crazy, you're just making up facts!
 I told it to myself. I got all this information, but nobody listened.
 What about this girl you say you think is a real psychic?
 No.
 What if you don't know who I am?
 Oh my God, that's great. It makes you really cool. Okay, you're just here, you don't need to be nervous!
 Yeah.
 What are you looking for?
 Oh.
 I...
 I mean, it's just not what this guy needs right now, is it?
 You should see this...
 He's all alone!
 You can't do this.
 He's a lot stronger than I will!
 I'll be fine.
 How are we gonna help you?
 Sure.  Thanks.  Here you go.
 Don't you have your ID?
 We've got a real problem.
 No.
 He'll see!
 Yeah, yeah.
 I don't know what to do. It's like, we don't have anything.
 That's where you are. Let's see.
 Let's be frank, Mr. Kremers. We already can't get the kid from school and I don't know what you're thinking. He just turned out to be the best thing since sliced bread. That's why he's a kid. We're taking him home.
 Hey, you think I'm kidding?
 You know, what he's doing is nothing new.
 What's happening to him?
 What?
 Who?
 What?
 That's what happened!
 You don't seem surprised, Mr. Kremers.
 What?
 He told me he's going to have to work on his confidence.
 Is he going to be okay with the new situation?
 Well, you know, the kid may have thought I was going to bring him home.
 Yes?
 It doesn't matter.  I'm not gonna take this guy home like I used to have.
 I can't believe it!
 He's gonna be okay.
 So how is this guy today?
 Yes, Mr. Kremers, we're ready for our next assignment.
 No, Mr. Kremers, you're right. I'm gonna make you work for me. I can't believe it.
 Yeah.
 I'd rather you go.
 That way you'll be on the best seat on the train!
 Okay, that's my seat, Mr. Kremers. I'll take you home!
 It's okay, Mr. Kremers.  You were in a wheelchair when you got here. I'll take you home now. Thank you.
 I wish -- 
 The girl I was with is with you.
 What are you talking
