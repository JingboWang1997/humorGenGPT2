 companion's son.
 No thanks.  Just this. I've got nothing in the cupboard.
 What's in the cupboard?
 How about a few more.
 Oh, sure.
 Well, if you're the sort who'll read my poetry and see my old chap written.
 No ma'am.
 Just read it to you.
 Oh, that was a long time ago.
 Oh, that's a good poem.
 It'll be so sweet to me.  It'll just be a very special poem.  Do you mind?  It'll be for you too.  It'll be for you.
 I'll have to.
 Don't get involved. Don't get involved in the thing. I'm sorry about the people who have this trouble.
 Yes ma'am.  I'll read them.
 Oh, what I can do?
 How about these? Oh, don't worry.
 No ma'am.
 Well, no ma'am has done any of it. I know they're good poems.
 Oh, just a little.
 Oh, not a thing, a poem, and a couple of sheets of paper.  How about you, Mr. Bum?
 Well, yes, they are good poems.  I wouldn't be surprised if they do come. I wouldn't expect many.
 Of poetry.
 Of what? Oh yes, I have done some of it.
 Have you, Mr. Bum? You know, and are you a poet?
 Ah, yes, of a poem.
 Not really.
 Oh, yes, that is a good poem.  You have finished it?
 Not really.
 Oh, yes, I have finished that.  I have finished it.
 Oh, yes, this is a good poem.  Have you finished it?
 Oh, yes, this poem.
 Yes, a poem?
 Yes.
 Have you, Mr. Bum?
 Oh, yes, yes, I have.
 Oh, yes, I have.  Have you, Mr. Bum?
 Oh, yes, yes, I have.
 The poem?
 Yes.
 Oh, yes, you must know, Mr. Bum the poet.  And of course I have a poem called "My Heart."
 Oh, yes, yes.  Yes, you must have one or both.  Have you, Mr. Bum, would you?
 Oh, yes, yes, you do.
 You see, Mr. Bum, you are very pretty.
 Yes?
 Yes?
 Well, sir, I am.
 Oh, yes, yes, but what can I do?
 My father is a surgeon.
 Yes?
 Your name?
 Yes?  Well, sir, I'm a singer.
 Yes, you mean a poet?
 Yes, sir.
 Yes?
 Yes?
 Yes?
 But, sir?
 Sir?
 Yes?  Yes?
 Sir?
 Yes, a bit.  A bit.
 Sir?
 Yes?
 Well, sir?
 Yes?
 Oh, yes, yes, the poems.
 Well, sir, what do you think, Mr. Bum?  Do you find poems charming?
 Yes?
 Mr. Bum?
 Yes, yes.
 Oh, yes.  Yes?
 Yes, well, sir, I found them in your books and in your poems, but not in the way you described.
 No, I'm sure you'll be surprised.
 I think, sir, I find these very charming.
 Oh, yes, that's wonderful!  And what doth this book contain?
 Now, Sir, I must first ask you a few questions, that are really only intended to be asked after the reading of the book.
 Ah, yes, yes, my dear, it's been a long time.
 You have, Mr Bum.
 Ah, yes, yes, yes, oh yes, it is that.  I have, quite rightly, been quite quiet about this for some time now.
 Yes, but in your books there are poems, poems written for the sake of living.
 Yes, you mean poetry?
 Ah, yes, Yes, yes!  Oh yes, yes.
 Sir?
 Yes, sir?
 Yes?
 Yes, sir?
 Sir?
 Yes, sir?
 Yes, sir?  Yes?
 Yes, it is what?
 No, sir?
 Yes, sir?
 Yes, sir?
 Yes, sir?
 Sir?
 Yes, yes. He's my man.
 Yes?
 Yes, sir?
 Yes, sir?
 Yes, I know.
 Yes, sir?
 Yes, Sir?  Yes, I am.
 Yes, yes, yes. Yes, I do.
 Yes
