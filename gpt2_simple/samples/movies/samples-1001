======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 you do?"
 "I don't know."
 You're not saying she didn't exist. Why do you think she existed?
 I've always wondered it myself. She's just somebody on the inside. I'm just here to keep an eye on my little sister.
 You were there. You heard everything it said.
 She's not real.
 No, please, I don't think that way. She is here to get away from us.
 What do you think? Did anyone ever tell you that?
 I know. It was strange. Then I met the other one.
 What is the matter with you?
 You got away from me?
 You are... I could see it before you left. I just can't see how it could be anyone, even if it is, in all the time you were here to see me...
 So am I.
 But it wasn't any one person...  And I've never seen anybody like this before.  I can't remember him being this... happy. He must've been a little crazy. Not the kind of crazy you do in your sleep.  I haven't seen this before. He must look so... happy.
 That's no good.
 I don't want to sleep any more, you see, so please don't let me wake up. You think maybe, you heard some strange noise... I'm sorry... but I don't want to wake the other one...
 Do you want to sleep?
 And let me get this straight. I'm going to sleep. Please.
 What's it matter with? What's the matter with us? You're the only one who can wake her.
 So, let me try. Do you want to wake her or not? Do you want to know her?
 She didn't want to do this.
 Why didn't you ask me?
 Yes.  It's all my fault.  Let me just look at her for a moment.
 Can I please see something, please?
 I guess you have some kind of a thing for a girl... not a girl who'd let someone do it... for herself...
 Yes.  But she's so pretty... so beautiful. What could I do, if anything good or bad could be done... even by her...?
 I could never go through that...
 Did I tell you to take her home?
 It was strange... it was strange... she just seemed so... happy... so... well... so.
 Did you see how happy she was... how happy she looked... how she had her hand out... how she kissed him?
 I wouldn't say anything... she was just talking... you know how she says to talk...  It was the strangest thing...
 I want to go home and wake her.
 No.  No.
 It's alright.
 What is your name?
 What is this place?
 Are you afraid, sir? There's danger... danger... She shouldn't be here.  I can't understand how she can do this...
 I'm just worried... She'll wake me... and what's she doing...?
 You're not afraid.
 She must be here somewhere.
 Could she be here... now?... Can I sleep?
 I think we're all ready... We shouldn't be talking if something could be done. There are things to be done... Things we could take...
 What could we talk about?
 She'll be fine, she always is.... I have to... just...  I... I can't... I had something to talk about... she didn't want to... I think...
 Then... you should probably find some way to go home... I'm sure her brother won't be able to go near that place now.
 No.
 I was just talking... do you mind if I get some water? We're in a little cold, we ought to have some ice.
 You don't believe me.
 I think you didn't see her face. She was looking down at you... looking.... looking...
 How was she?
 It was nice... so nice... so quiet... so... so... peaceful... so... so...
 Did you see her face? I remember what this was like... so calm... so... so just... so gentle... so... so... so... peaceful, so...  And she had her hands out... she was looking at you, and touching you, and... and she was... she had these big, beautiful little hands... and her face... was shining...  Now she was looking...
 I'm not afraid.  I'll be fine.  I'll be right.
 We'll get her... we'll talk... go home. I'll see you... don't bother to lock the door. You'll need it...  She's a lot stronger than you think, you know...
 If you say anything... you'll die!  Please, let me
