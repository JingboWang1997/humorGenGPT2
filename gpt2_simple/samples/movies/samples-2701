======== SAMPLE 1 ========
!, you can't just walk out on us for this, no matter how much you hate this, no matter what you say you can't just stand there and say so. So you've got the wrong people in this place. And no one's going to let you stay.
 Yeah.
 So?
 It's the best thing for them. The only thing they know how to do is beat you every step of the way. And this can be done. And they can do it.
 Oh.
 There's no reason for this -- not only for you, but for everyone who's got a reason for coming to America every single day.
 But it's not just me.
 Look at the people that've gone.
 No.
 It's the best thing for them.
 You're kidding --
 They're already on their way.
 You mean --
 They don't want to talk to you right now.
 I've got a plan.
 What do you mean --
 It's not just you, it's everybody --
 Oh --
 It's not working, Jack --
 They've been trying to talk you down.
 No, no --
 We can't stand it anymore.
 Look at me too, Jack --
 Oh, you get rid of her, we'll take her out.
 No, I can't.
 It's getting hot in here.
 Okay -- I said let go of her.
 I was going to --
 The police have gotten so much bad press so they didn't know about you. You'd feel so good in here with you safe and sound. You've got me.
 No.
 Do you want some advice from me -- what else could I give you?
 What if my plans get ruined? Do you want to leave me out of everything? Do you want any help?
 Oh -- I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry, but I can't leave you out of it either.
 Good.
 You're in the next room.
 Good.
 We're going to leave you here.
 Oh -- you know you can trust me.
 I think I can trust you.
 What can I give you?
 Do you want any advice from me -- what else can I give you?
 Jack -- I want to give you something --
 If you keep her tied up and don't let her go.
 What if she won't leave?
 Are you sure?
 Jack, I need you to do something.
 No -- Jack --
 Are you sure?
 I -- I have to --
 Jack, shut up.
 I've got to --
 Why not?
 I don't think Jack can be trusted.
 No -- I mean just the same -- no one else could pull her like that --
 She's just too valuable --
 Oh -- well, I guess we could always find another one.
 How many do we have left?
 It's just one of those things -- you don't pull her off, you break her face and then you get it back.
 Okay, Jack.
 No -- she's my best friend.
 You see all that pressure on you this whole time -- all the time -- and I guess in the end the person you've got right now is the one who's going to be your best friend.  That's the problem.
 I'm pretty sure Jack's going to come out of the woodwork just like Jack's dad did. He's gonna be good at it. But at the end of it, Jack's really gonna be Jack.
 He's got to come out of the woodwork, Jack -- and he's got to do it before Jack ever sees the rest of the picture. At least that's the feeling.
 No, thank you so much -- thank you a million times over and I couldn't be more sorry Jack's going to be there -- I wish I could be there!
 He's here because you need a help -- and you're right. We should be together now.
 Thank you.
 Jack --
 So -- that's exactly what I'm going to do.
 Oh no -- he's not gonna say anything. His father isn't going to be happy about it, he'll be worried about you. He's just going to be happy having it all laid out this way. And you're going to help him.
 Do it.
 He knows me.
 Is it just my imagination here -- or is he out of his mind?
 What do you think Jack's going to say now?
 No -- Jack.
 Jack.
 Hello?
 You can call me any time -- I just have some time.
 Well, I'd rather have you call me -- I wouldn't feel that way.
 I'm sorry.
 Good.
 Great. Go on.
 It's getting dark.
 I have another favor to ask. Is she with Dad this time?
 What are you doing?
