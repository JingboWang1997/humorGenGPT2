======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 life on Earth is just a couple of weeks.
 I see it, I get that feeling of being stuck here.  I want to know that.
 I'm sorry I haven't answered.  When I saw the picture I always thought one of the guys with the orange jumpsuit would win, so I kept it real. Now it's coming to me like a light-year away from me.  In this picture I'm a different kind of guy.  I don't need a girlfriend anymore...
 Why is everything weird?  You were talking about going on your dates?  Was that how you felt?  Did you have fun?
 Why is everything weird?
 Okay, I was just in the neighborhood and...
 But, this is a really great one. A really great one.
 What's the matter?
 I remember it.  I remember when I was a kid and...
 This is all different.
 Uh, I... I've never told anyone about it.
 Oh... really...?
 Oh -- really.
 What else?  What else?
 It was a car accident.  I have a car accident, don't I?
 I just came back from New York.  That happened... and uh... I don't even want to talk about it 'cause maybe it won't last.
 What's wrong?'
 What is that?
 Huh?
 You?... Huh?
 And, what's the matter?  The weather changed up here.
 No, of course not.  You're the one who's been in the sun.  I'm the one who's been soaking.  But I'm the only one who...
 There's nothing about it, I know I'm a woman.  I know you know all you have to hide behind is a smile and a small voice,  and your mouth.
 I'm not.
 It's really, really important.
 You're so happy you haven't told me, are you?  How many people know... how many...  the beauty I'd never heard of.
 Oh, no, the little girl's... how the little girl's happy?
 What?
 So?  That was a little scary...
 No.  And it wasn't my fault.  She was just playing along.
 You don't believe the word that came out of my mouth.  They said you've just found that word?
 No, not that I know of.  I didn't say it at the time, but that I couldn't believe you're actually listening to something like that.
 I don't know what you mean, but...
 So, for a day after I gave you that letter.
 But what about the phone?  Now if the phone's been damaged, can they be used? This is something if you have it.
 You can't have been as careful as you thought.
 Well, what is this?
 Well...
 I'd just like to say goodbye.
 How you feeling?  Did you?
 Oh, I can't do it.
 That makes you feel good, doesn't it?
 Hey, man.
 Well, well, hey, you're getting out of here.  You're going to get some exercise, and maybe you can have a few things to eat...
 Ohh, so I see.
 My brother didn't want me to leave his job back in San Quentin.  He was afraid I'd get involved.  You know, in spite of all the... that's how it happened.  His wife... she was working the day he was supposed to be working.  She didn't see him leaving until the first weekend of his life.
 You did?
 No.
 You do?
 Uh-huh.  That's all right.  I was a lawyer, and he... he was a supervisor.  He was supposed to be working...
 Well, uh... my brother, one of the most powerful lawyers I ever had -- he was the one who ran the law firm in San Quentin.
 And you was a lawyer.
 I was a lawyer, I think.
 And your brother had just been released.  How long was he being away?
 He was at my firm.
 Yes?  And how was the family?
 In spite of everything, I loved that boy. In spite... well, I was sort of sad about it, so I sent him off to the desert and... I ended up, he went up to Idaho and I ended up dying, but it was a really great thing, I was there, of course, but it happened anyway.  A really big family was.
 Is that how you did it?  He was trying to make a name for himself...
 He was at college to be a lawyer, but the school board wasn't going to take him.  He had this friend, we call him the first, the first person that
