======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 no real hope for the city, but we can take care of that, okay? I do. Look, the first thing we have to do is start planning.  It seems like we're going to have to keep getting a sense of what's going on for a while. I don't want us to be just like you, and like you alone.  You know, that feeling I talked about before.  I haven't been able to take any of it, and I want to go on staying in touch with you. I know sometimes it's hard to talk to you without putting my name on it.  Don't worry though, I know I said it before, but there are some things you have to do.
 So, you did.  You got that job with the cops, right?
 You'll have to let me show you some.
 This is good for you.  You feel like a professional.  You talk to your old friend.  You put up new signs to advertise the fact that you're no longer the only thing in that town.
 Sure.  I didn't expect it, but this morning I just got a very nice little piece of it.
 What is it?
 Don't worry, we'll be fine.  You won't have to get up at eight.
 I was going to have you to sit here all afternoon before you got something more important to talk about, but that's just too bad.  If you ever have trouble with your father, he was really good for you.
 I don't know.  Maybe I'll tell you more when you get home.
 You need a doctor.  Can't you get a doctor?
 What happened?
 How was all that?
 What does this mean?
 She just got back.  Look, I hope everything goes to plan, but don't give up.  When you get back I want you to meet my sister in New York.
 What does it look like today?
 Yeah.  It looks pretty good.
 I'll give you whatever you need.  This is your only chance at getting a new car.  My sister lives over there.  I'd love to have you go with her, you know?
 I don't know.  Nothing seems out of whack.  I do wonder though, you think things have improved?
 Have you been able to get a new car since you were here?
 Okay, I think we're done up here, and we should be heading back.
 I suppose no one's going to like it back home, but let's just stay here, I'll be sure to call you later.
 Yeah, you're going out to get a new one.
 Hi.
 Hi.
 Don't you ever leave me.  You don't know what you're doing, but you do it anyway.
 You know, you're the best.
 Why?
 You know, things are good between you and me.  We're married.  But I've noticed that sometimes you always put my name on the news.  You know, a friend of a friend.  Somebody I really know.  And when I think of you and my name, I always come up in the news, and I wish you luck with that, because you're in a really good place right now.
 I guess the city has grown a bit larger than we might normally imagine.  The city is so beautiful.  You know, just from looking across the street at these streets, I get the feeling you have better plans in mind.
 Yes, you've been doing all that, the newspapers, and I should let you know that I feel you've been trying.  And I'm very disappointed.
 But you promised!
 No.  No, I'm not.  You know my story, you just haven't come up.
 I think you're doing the best you can.
 I'm very, very sorry.  I didn't know how to tell you this, but you're coming up to New York.  I'm afraid, don't you want me to show you my car, to tell you where I'll live, but I'm going to tell you I feel so bad that I'll never see you again, and now I have to tell you.
 I don't want to hear you say it.  It hasn't been the best life I've had.  I just miss it.  I feel better being alone.  How's your life here?
 I'm sorry.
 You're not a bad boy, do you know that, are you?  It's not your fault you have to leave home. In a long time you'll have me like that.  I don't want you to be alone in a very, long time.
 No, I think you'll find them at the local corner, like me.  Sooner or later you need someone of that caliber to know you
