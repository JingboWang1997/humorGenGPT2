======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 is a great, very proud lady - and one who is very much in love with the Lord. So, when you begin to show me, my Lord gives me great pleasure and hope. I have not had enough time for a very good woman, since you left. I am beginning to lose my patience. And when it comes that I am the wife of the most noble man whom the Lord has chosen - I think the Lord says it is better than marriage. And I see to it that you cannot be the widow of the Lord's most beloved servant, because it is contrary to the dignity of marriage.
 Of course.
 I know that, my Lord - and I know that I would do nothing like to suggest that you should.
 I see not the problem and will not have to, but perhaps - and probably at some point in your life - you feel that there is something you desire: to start a life without the wife or to settle for something you do not want.
 You know that what I am is not right. The only matter I care about is whether I should marry someone I do not choose.
 I would like that, my lord.
 And I understand it you've been thinking of moving away from this house and finding some good work elsewhere.
 And where is it?
 And I would like that, my lord.
 And if you were not interested what would happen? Are women an acceptable substitute?
 Yes, but I think it is not too late for you to get married. Do you understand? This is life and death for me - and I do not believe my marriage with Mary, I know everything that is good in it. And I want not to have children of my own. Do you understand? I will do something for you if you will allow me to do what I love. Is that so much too much?
 Yes - of course there is.
 You see, my dearest Mary - I have come to do the right thing - I will do what I love best - I will do what I am not used to do. But that is not good enough. And then I might not do the things I love, but perhaps you would.
 But if I should be wrong I might be very wrong - I might be very sick indeed.
 My Lord - I love you so - and I will always love you.
 And I should be right about this - I will be right.
 Yes. Do so do so, my lord - do so do so.
 Do so, my lady - do you know that for me and my only joy is to be in the presence of the Lord?
 Yes, my Lord.
 Do you love my Lord?
 Yes, my lord.
 Do you love the Lord?
 Yes, my lady.
 And what about the children?
 Yes, my lord.
 Do you love me?
 I know you've been trying to find some decent work, to change that. But I also know I could never live without my children - I love them so much.
 Oh yes indeed I am, my lord; and I have found the Lord and I love the Lord.
 You've found Jesus, my lady.
 Oh my Lord - I do indeed love you.
 Yes, I know - and I love you.
 Because I adore you.
 Please, my Lord - do you know that I have found him?
 Yes, my lady - how could you love me?
 Do you love me? I don't need to live without my children.
 No, my lord - I can't live without my children!
 Does the word love mean something in this?
 Yes, my lady; for me and for all those I loved - because I loved them the same way I know they must feel.
 You know how it must feel.
 Oh my Lord - I have loved many lovers - like you have loved me.
 And for those who have loved me more than I have loved them?
 Then you can't be that good a wife, my lord. You will have to try to love me the same way they must love you. How can you love Mary for whom God has given so much - because when you begin to love her, it feels natural to love Mary the same way you would like to love Mary?
 No, Mary - I just wanted to find some quiet before you came. I wanted to ask you something - to do something for you I can do.
 You know what is, I would say, is, that the most important thing.
 No - I want to ask you some simple questions I haven't had the pleasure of asking before.
 Oh my Lord - I beg you - don't you know why?
 Yes, my lord - yes - I have seen many great masters and it is possible that I have met one of them in life.
 Yes, I know of one.
 Do you know Mary?
 Yes - she is beautiful - the most beautiful
