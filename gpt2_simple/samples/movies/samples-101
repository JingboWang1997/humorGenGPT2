 time. But it's important that you get it, too. That's not the same as giving up the idea that it really matters to you.
 And then how about...
 I should probably go back and try to make up with him after dinner. You look like a decent man. That's a good thing. I think he'll agree.
 I think not. And, if he really wants to go back, he would be perfectly happy to have you here.
 The last time I made a mistake...
 She really does have a nice, quiet way of acting, isn't she?
 That's what she says.
 I suppose. That's right, then. But then, she never really wanted to talk to me--
 You want her to?
 There wasn't anything there.
 I'd think so... But my father would look at me oddly if I saw him--
 Whoa, don't go right for him-- That's right--
 Yes--
 Why can't I think of someone to sleep in my bed with?
 What kind of idea are you having?
 That's right... I'd suppose--
 That's how my father used to take me. He'd get me in bed, and-- I'd just let him out, like a little boy would sleep under a bed. Don't be silly, my dear. In fact, he would give me a look as if I'd let him out. You're not going to sleep under a bed, aren't you? You're going to sleep in my bed--
 She's very pretty. If you want, can you get in bed for a little while?
 You are, aren't you? And if I was, what were I going to do about you? Don't you ever forget that, then? Remember that... Remember that, then.
 I used to do everything, don't I? I had to. I was always doing everything.
 Yes. You can't deny it. There we go.
 But, dear, why haven't you ever done anything?
 Did you hear? You could never have imagined so much of a future, could you? You could never have dreamed if it had never happened.
 That's right. I wish you'd taken me in your arms a moment ago, just to remind you about those first days with me when you really cared about something?
 Yes, of course, if I'd been a man--
 I remember being one when you first came here. But the idea doesn't really hit you until much later--
 Don't think so--
 It's nothing that--
 You're a man, aren't you?
 Don't think so--
 I never noticed that when you were so much happier...
 You don't really--
 I did, yes, but I was the person who had to look after us both. I remember thinking that you couldn't tell me anything because there wasn't that much between you and me. But I guess I just couldn't find my head for it until I had a better life. Well, after a couple of years, I'd find things-- or I'd forget--
 I mean, in college. You were a professor here, didn't you? You were a student there!
 That wasn't there then, but it's been there since then-- and I'm glad to see things like it...
 I haven't thought of her--I've always thought of my brother a little more--
 We're very fortunate to have so many things, aren't we?
 It's--it's not the--it's not--it's nothing--that's right--it's--it's--it's a--it's--
 It's--it's-- it's--it's things...
 You want the things that matter, aren't you? Things that matter?
 I never really thought, but I suppose I didn't really know until recently--and a lot of things have always mattered to me--
 Nothing, at first--
 You've had to listen to some things--it was--it was--it was--it was. Not anything you've ever--
 A little--a little--something--it has--I've never--I've never--
 I thought it should matter--
 Yes.
 Your brother's been--I mean, I thought--I thought--I thought that didn't matter--maybe it was just--
 Not as much as you think.
 I never meant--I never intended... I--I--
 No.
 Of course. Well--oh, you haven't--have I--?
 I never--I think I--I--I have just sometimes wanted--
 I should--
 I don't think I--
 I always thought--I--I never--
 You didn't think so...
 And you-- I--I think I--
 But how are you--
 And I--I think--
 I never
