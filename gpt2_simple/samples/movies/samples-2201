======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Senior the three of you, and if you've got a minute make yourself at home.
 They were supposed to be going for a walk, I'm sure.
 And the kids?  What's our mother-in-law doing here?
 Don't you dare ask me anything about your health.
 What about Mom?
 Why must I leave now?
 And you are sure?
 You're very tired.
 You look tired, thank you.
 Well, you're right to get up at last, you see, it is quite early. Do you feel like going out for a walk?
 You won't find him here.
 It's awfully cold.
 Who could I look for him?
 You know my father is very much missed. He is not a man to leave such an unpleasant woman -- that means his life is in pieces with a bad feeling. You are not likely to find him here.
 Yes. And there's my husband Thomas.
 Yes, I'd have no reason to expect him in any other way than he may be in trouble.
 Not if it's over with.
 Well, you are not a long way from home. He never was quite prepared for anything. He lived here for a period. I should say a couple of days ago.
 I would hope so, but I don't think I can understand -- that you could not have done anything with that boy or even if you had any idea that he wasn't in need.
 No. I have been very busy with him and you have no idea what I have been up to these past two days. I suppose I must be getting back to my own duties, or perhaps I have something to do with him, but I am not able to do that now.
 It is over, really, I wouldn't have expected anything of him.
 I have known your husband for many years, not so much for his family as for those who deal with him. I have often wondered if he really had any children.
 Oh.
 He has very short legs. I like him. I don't mind his work, but he is awfully tall.
 Whereabouts?
 I don't know.
 Why?
 Yes, he lived and died at home. He was very much a part of the family.
 I have had a few days in my life where the weather has been pleasant.
 Of what?
 As far as I am aware, they were very happy.
 In what way?
 I don't know, maybe he would like to see some of the houses and he has a good collection.
 Does he know that?
 The day I met him was the day the rain stopped. He never goes out and I suppose he would like to.
 What's the problem?
 It's pretty chilly, isn't it?
 It was very nice, you know? I mean, I'd probably have taken a horse to ride around the garden in it if I didn't have to wear rain boots, and he looked as you did when I did. We spent the evening on the sofa talking. I was very proud of you.
 I was just having dinner in the car with Mr. Green.
 I'm glad to meet you. You certainly are a nice lady, and you are a rather interesting woman.
 It doesn't help that there seem to be quite a lot of problems at play today, isn't it?
 Oh, thank you very much. Of course.
 A big one of them?
 I suppose I am.
 I'm afraid I don't have a good enough education to have done much on my own. I guess I am, aren't I?
 No, thank you very much, no I wouldn't want one.
 Have you done any reading on your education?
 Yes, I'd like to read a little.
 Do you have any children?
 Yes.
 When have you ever left England?
 You do, I hope that helps, doesn't it?
 Yes, well, when I was going to England was the way things turned up was that I got a little boy and he took me away from England a little. When I went back -- it was very much, well, the way things turned up was that I spent Christmas with his daddy -- it was very much a different world. But what are you doing here? What's the matter?
 Yes! I believe in them quite a lot.
 You believe in them?
 Oh, they would get a lot of use, wouldn't they? When you want to. You know, we could put them to school every now and then -- that's what school the rest think.
 Are they doing well in your school?
 Well, it wasn't exactly a problem, but you did worry about them too.
 That would surely be no problem, isn't it?
 I am. I just had a couple of boys and girls going to school today. But I don't
