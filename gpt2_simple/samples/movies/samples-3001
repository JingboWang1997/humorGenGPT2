======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 your what you want with the help of these people, isn't it?
 No.  I've never even seen "Dynasty" before.
 I've never seen this game before ...  ... and the music is like none of the others, is it?
 And you did say you were on an airplane tonight, you haven't even mentioned the game ... how about you give it another go-go and go away?
 Of course not ...
 And you're saying like some kind of a joke?
 There is no such thing.
 But you can use this.
 I can't use this!
 Not even a small boy can take such a powerful song - I don't even need clothes!
 The tune...
 "It's a small thing, a delicate thing..."
 And the melody...
 Of course not.  This is a song written by a little girl.  She wants to sing.
 It's a beautiful song ... but the first number is...
 I've always been a bit lost at words, you know.
 I'm sure it is.
 That's very interesting.
 It's a song.
 What do you mean?
 What is it?
 "A little girl cries for some little angelic thing to be sent away to make her sad ..."
 And what exactly are you ...
 I'm not sure I know what it is.  Maybe it's a song.
 It must be a song.
 A very tiny little boy has just come to cry on a small little sheet of wax ...
 You're sure it isn't a joke?
 Well, I'm sure you're not ... You're not supposed to write that kind of thing, are you?
 It's only a little bit.
 You're sure you're not afraid of that music...
 Don't make me laugh.
 What a silly thing to be proud of ... You may as well let me know before somebody gets their hands on that sheet of wax...
 But you don't know that music is even in existence ...
 No, I just happen to have it!
 Maybe you're afraid of that music?
 I don't know whether to laugh or cry, and I know this is a silly thing to be ashamed of, but as long as the other person doesn't take me for granted, I'm sure there are people out there who do ... I don't know what it is.
 Why do you do that?
 "And one must sing the praises of the Lord."
 I didn't hear that.
 Yes you do.
 You can be a nice person, an honest person, as long as you've never written that kind of thing.
 Well, if it's really a matter of faith, then I'll say I'm glad that the Lord sent the music over the wall to me.
 So now I'm a girl too ...
 It has absolutely no bearing on the game ...
 Well, I didn't play the whole thing at a small party. What's the matter with you, Mr. Dickson?
 I did.
 Have you played the game with him?
 I wasn't there.
 Oh ... I didn't see that one.  It's the same game with the piano.  You're playing the drums and the bass.  The melody's all the same.
 I'm looking for a song ... a theme ...
 I know what you mean when you say that.  I've been singing since I can still remember.
 Yes, you do, Mr. Dickson ... and I'll tell you again, you don't know that music's even in existence. All I can say is that it sounds pretty ... it's only a little bit ... but that's only because it's been done before.
 Oh, I wouldn't know, Mr. Dickson.
 Yes ... but it does. And it's absolutely beautiful -- it's nothing compared to anything else, I wouldn't want to lose that.
 Oh, we could. My favourite place in town. There are so many great things to do during the holidays.
 The music's in my room.
 It looks like a gift; where'd it come from?
 It's from the Lord.
 But what's the matter with you?
 Oh, I had a surprise for you!
 You'll stop that now and for a while.
 Oh, you don't even know that music exists!
 Mr. Dickson ...
 I'm afraid that's an impossible question, Mr. Dickson.
 And how did you know about it?
 Oh, the music ... yes. I know very well about the music.
 Is music a very common theme?
 Of course not. It's very nice.
 It is very beautiful you know that?
 The air is so fine ...
 It's only a little wind. It's not that kind of wind ...
 How was it, then?
 I was ... a little bit afraid.
 Have
