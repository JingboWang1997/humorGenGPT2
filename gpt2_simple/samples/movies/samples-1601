 more: she will always be.
 We know we do. So why do you continue to deny that we do?
 The people have a right to know, not just some politician.
 I've got to go.  But don't think for a second...
 Your mother is coming.
 No you don't. You can only assume.
 You know, I think I should call it a "whistle-blower."
 I can't.
 You have a call.
 No, I think we should make a statement. Something that will be more than just a comment.
 Why aren't you calling, honey?
 I think we've all come to the same conclusion.
 I knew you'd call.
 I don't want my father to stop my work, it's not good enough for me anymore.
 Why don't you sit down and talk with your mother?
 It'll take longer for me to call him. The phone call's coming soon. He might miss it.
 I'm sorry. She won't get through without calling.
 I told you - I thought you were going to phone him.
 I called him! There'll be more.
 You'll be late for dinner.
 But I don't know my father.
 It's a small world, honey. You haven't seen him since he came home.
 What do you say?
 I didn't think you were so...
 Why don't you go get him?
 Yes I will, Mr. Geller.
 I promise you, I will call.
 I will, Mr. Geller.
 I'll call.
 I don't know.
 That you won't call?
 Mr. Geller, I'm afraid I don't know the number for your father. I call the only number in the area.
 It's me.
 Please. I promise I won't call the number.
 I can't call that number. They're out of service.
 That's why I'm calling number 857.
 How did you know my dad was involved in this?
 Mr. Geller, I have been called. My father is at his office.
 Tell me. How did you know my dad was involved in this?
 That was me.
 You're getting so used to calling that number. Tell her you'll call my dad?
 I can't call the number. There's an outhouse. If I call it, I'll tell them to let you in the house. Just leave me alone. My dad is at the back.
 If I call your dad, I'll tell them to let you in the house. Just leave me alone.
 I haven't met her yet.
 You should call if you see her.  I'm coming down.
 We're late.
 What's wrong with this!
 You shouldn't be here.
 No. I had plans but I had to go to the airport.
 You have to bring something to eat, Mr...
 Where are your parents?
 Mr...
 I... I didn't think you'd be home until ten.
 Yes. What?
 We're on the way.
 What is it?
 Yes?
 Can't find your phone
 What's the matter?
 I'll be right down.
 You're supposed to be doing this!
 My dad's still in bed. He needs help getting a dress in.
 Your parents are in bed.
 I've got to help my dad.
 You're not being very helpful.
 What do you mean, "I need you"?
 Mr. Geller, can't I leave you now?
 I had to find out where I could. I was... trying to get a cab or something.
 Why did you have to come?
 It's... it's... it's... it's...
 Don't you see that? That's the phone number.
 The number.
 No you don't! The phone number.
 The number.
 No!
 It'll only take three minutes.
 Can you do that. I'm getting dressed right now!
 I'll call this number
 I'll be right down.
 The number.
 How does he know where he can get a cab?
 I know where he can get a cab, but...
 I'll have a nice taxi.
 What's the number?
 No and...
 Why don't you just be polite.
 Sure...
 Sure it is.
 It is?
 It isn't.
 How long has it been?
 Sure it is, but - 
 It isn't.
 No.
 No.
 I've come for a week. It's okay, it's fine.
 It's okay
 No, I'm not.
 No you don't, I'm really sorry, I'm so sorry


 You're a really good girl.
 You're wonderful...
 You're terrible
