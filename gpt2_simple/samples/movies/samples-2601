 uses.
 You think he can go on the defense?
 He is a good man.
 Who is this?
 I don't trust anyone. I never even know when to give or take.
 He's a good man.
 And I like you.
 We are all.  And I am the one you've been talking about.
 You're saying you think I'm a bad man?
 You think my life could work out all right if I were to take everything and go out in a blaze of glory, then find out later that I was wrong? I don't like that.
 You think he should've been there?
 The question remains, Mr. Mayor, what does it matter when a man goes for a short trip like this? I'm sure a lot of his neighbors were wondering the same thing.
 I didn't mean that, I said, when you did what you did for him that he got away?
 I thought it might be very nice if he were here to take my hand. Can I have a word for you?
 I'll see. Can you, too?
 Can you leave. Do not leave.
 Could you go in and see somebody?
 The night is coming and the sun is shining. If you were to leave, they'd leave me. I've the money.
 I must see something.
 You must have an idea of what things are in front of you, sir?
 What?
 Can I go in?
 There's nothing here. Do not.
 Maybe we ought to have thought this was not very friendly?
 That's not what I was talking about.
 A fine night for a fine dinner.
 Fine, sir.
 The one you just said, my wife?
 Perhaps we ought to have taken you to dinner last night instead.
 What?
 I thought you ought to go to the garden after dinner.
 Don't let her go to work. I don't care to see her when she's not dressed. If you don't like that, let her go.
 Oh, I'll take her as a sister.
 Then let her get to work with us at the garden.
 I will not let her go to work tonight.
 I am tired.
 I had an order from my sister on my mind. She was looking for you in the garden and the garden belongs to the town.
 Yes, I know all about the money. My own old friend.
 He won't do it.
 I will let your father see his wife.
 All right. Let your father know the money.
 Well, if there is. Will he trust you to keep it in the house until it is very dry?
 There is nothing in the house, sir. Can't you see that?
 Well, if anyone gives you trouble, there is nobody to give it to.
 I need only your name and my address. Can you take the money and leave right away?
 My name is Smith. Your wife --
 I'm not like your mother and my wife. My name's not Smith and if I did I should not worry you, my wife or yourself more.
 Who is this, my boy?
 I thought you were a little afraid, sir, and I think you ought to know why.
 You're not going to have the money, I must say. I will have the money and can have it.
 Well, it has nothing to do with my wife.
 It's all right to keep the money. Do some other business.
 Oh, I know. It's a matter of opinion. It's a matter of principle. The only thing I ever wanted as a gift was the money. It's not for this. It's not because I'm tired of being asked for money. That's how stupid are you? It's all a matter of opinion. You're too clever you wouldn't dare say anything to me. It's because the money goes to the people, to the poor. It has to be for something, it's for a nice thing you thought I'd tell you if you asked me to take it.
 I'll tell you what. It's a gift. It belongs to me. Give me the money, and if you think I can help you -- you're not going to have it. I could put it aside. And if you insist, I'll get some money. But I won't. I'll get the money and then give it to you. Your life is my life. You may go to hell. How can you think about that? The only thing I want as a gift.
 Yes.
 Give me the money?
 I'll give you everything you want to have.
 You know what you wanted for?
 I'll have more money.
 Where is the money? Where's the money?
 What do you want?
 Yes, I wanted to give you a present.
 This is why we haven't got
