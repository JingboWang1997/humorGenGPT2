".'s the same thing.
 Oh, yes.
 There's a lot that goes unnoticed.
 I understand.  I've heard about you.  You're a star.
 He's not.  But don't feel sorry for him.  That's who he is.
 Do you believe those guys?  You didn't just come to see the guy.  You went out for good reasons, remember?
 Yes, he did.
 Did you talk to him?  What did he do?
 If I'm right, this whole thing might not be so serious.
 No, I didn't see him.
 Look, I wasn't thinking that I was gonna take him home. I can tell you one thing.
 You just did.  You are so lucky I didn't kill him.
 What the hell are you doing here?
 I can tell you one thing, Mrs. Collins.  This is going to happen some time.
 You think it's my fault?
 I knew the day the bomb went off that it would happen.
 What do you want?
 A girl who's dying.
 Who's?
 It's going to happen tonight.
 Tell me what happened.
 But you had a very clear point.
 You think that's what happened - was that what I wanted to hear?
 I didn't know you had a secret.  Was it so clear?
 Why?
 I don't think you did.
 I know what happened.
 You know what happened?
 What happened?
 I think you should tell me.
 What the hell did I do - I let you do it?!
 You let me do it!
 You let me.  You let me do it!
 What in the name of Jesus Christ did you do?
 I want to know.
 What do you want me to tell you?
 What happened?
 Yes.
 Do you know what happened?
 That's great.  Well, the last time I spoke to him I could tell you this much.
 I want to know.
 Do you have a secret?  Do you have a secret?
 What the hell do you know?
 What?
 How would I know what?
 I have no idea.
 Do you know what happened?
 How do you know if I have a secret problem?
 I don't know if you can explain it well.
 You're not a person just like the others, you don't know what a person's problem is.
 How can people hide from the pain?
 I told you I'm not a person.
 You have a secret!
 They're people who've been traumatized by some horrible experience in their life.
 I don't like when people talk about your mother.
 I'm sorry.
 He was such a lovely man.
 How could he have been such a good father?
 He's very charming.
 He has a secret?
 It'll be fine, Dr. Collins.
 Let's have another look.
 It is very nice to be appreciated.
 I didn't know she could do anything like that.
 I told you.
 You do?
 I'm glad you're all healed, that's all.
 Thank you.
 I need you now.
 It's been an awful long time.
 He's not looking at me, but I'm not saying anything.  I'm just telling you what I know.
 You know I can't listen to this alone.
 You're asking me if I'm a liar.
 You don't believe it?  Why?
 Why didn't you tell me?
 I told you I don't know.
 Did you see him?
 A secret about a woman?
 Why didn't you tell me?
 A mystery!  You don't even know what a mystery is.
 Why did you tell me?
 A mystery.
 What a mystery?
 Something's there.  Something was there.  Something was somewhere. I don't know what's there.
 What is there?
 A secret.  A mystery.  A mystery.  It is where we're going, where we're going now.
 What?!
 Look here, you're not like them.  You're not like them at all.  You are different, in a lot of ways.
 You're a different kind of person, a very different kind.  You're in a lot of ways.
 It's just a coincidence.
 You didn't ask, did you, Dad?
 No.
 Dad?
 Dad.
 Dad...
 I can't see him tonight, Dad.
 He was so beautiful.
 You have a lot of fun, sweetie.  I guess I'm going to miss you.
 Don't cry, sweetie.
 I don't have to.  Don't cry. He doesn't look awful.
 I'm not crying.
