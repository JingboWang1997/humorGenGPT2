======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 is this really important?
 No.
 I understand. You really mean it, don't you?
 I just realized I would probably die in a fire without ever having been married to the man who's dead. That makes a difference.
 We won't. Not ever.
 I want to die!
 You don't want to die. You don't want to go on living.
 I want this.
 This would be beautiful.
 I was wrong.
 No. No. Not ever. Ever.
 Does that mean you have to?
 Not ever. Not ever.
 No. Never.
 Has your life started to change?
 No. Never been married. Always had children.
 No. I'm a single woman. I'm not a problem child.
 What is your real truth? Who are you?
 Yes.  I don't like that.
 You must choose your partner. Does it matter?
 No.
 Would you be comfortable with a sexual relationship?
 It's my life. I feel it. I feel it all the time. I have to be happy. I have to be happy. They are the ones who have to be happy.
 That's nice.
 You want to live that life.
 No. No. Not for me.
 Do you? Are you an emotional person?
 No. In fact, I can be. That's one of the reasons I can say it, 'I am not a problem child'. And I think it's right.
 Did you find it easy?
 Yes.
 You said something?
 No. And I didn't.
 So what do you want to do now? Are you going to change?
 For me? Or do I want a change?
 And I've only just started to. How am I going to do it?
 You've been talking to me my whole life. I don't know how to explain how happy you've made me about this to anyone else.
 It's just what I've always wanted to be a problem child. In a way, it's a part of me I've always wanted to be a problem child. Like the girl from The Bait.
 I was like, I wanted to be like you. I wanted to be like you.
 How did it ever work before?
 I think I needed you.
 So, how do you do it?
 No.
 You have to take responsibility for your decisions. You don't need me.
 No.
 You have to be honest. Is that honest?
 Yes.
 You. You don't make decisions on your own. You make choices on my behalf, and if you don't want to be my partner, that's okay.
 I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
 Are you a problem child?
 No, I'm not like that, I'm like this person...
 You don't.
 No, I'm not. And I know.
 You're different from everyone else in the world. Like you don't know anything, like you don't know what you want to do or what you want to do...
 No. No, I don't think anyone needs a doctor.
 Are you a problem child?
 Why are you so angry?
 What are you angry about?
 I feel that.
 She's going to see me.
 I'll get her.
 What are you going to do?
 What should I do? If he doesn't work for you, I'll be fine.
 What are you going to do?
 I'm just asking.
 What're you going to do?
 Oh yeah.
 I'll talk to you later...
 Is she really going to tell her friends and her family she's been with you?
 No.
 Will you tell her how nice it is. And why I should do it?
 I don't know.
 I think I know.  Oh, sure. I'm very happy, then. I don't know if you will ever make her happy.  Tell me. What do you want from me?
 No. What have I gotten myself into?
 Do you have any ideas about how to make her happy?
 Don't know you have.
 No, she's here. She's very good at your music. She is very nice. Maybe you could tell her about the first time you had a girlfriend. How you met your girlfriend. How you're in love with her. Or maybe she could tell me how it was when you married your fiance- an-                        . .and that we should just do it. It's all he could think of.
 What do you want from me?
 No, I mean, not at your wedding. But after my father dies he'll be really sad about.
 What
