..., I don't think it does--
 No, sir--but--
 Are they your brothers?  Are they your brothers who've been here?  Is that--what does that mean?
 I know--but...there was that.
 No, sir...
 I don't know.  I was just wondering...
 Where do you get it now, and from whom...and for how much...
 I'll send the money to you.
 Yes.  Now go.
 Where do we send the money, sir...
 I know, sir.
 We'll try to sell it at the store.
 Yes, sir.
 We have nothing in this store.  No one there will be willing to buy it.  Do you know where to get it, then?
 Yes, you do, sir.  What's the matter with this place?
 Yes, sir --and--
 I can assure you, sir--that, if any time you are, you will be there.
 Yes, sir.  I will be there.
 We're not having a party, Mr. Deaton, so I can assure you again--we're just trying not to embarrass your mother.
 Sir.
 I beg you--don't you have any other business here?
 Mr. Deaton, that was--that was a great deal too good, so I'm very glad it was canceled.
 Well, Mr. Deaton, I--I would call Mr. Deaton, Mr. Deaton--who are you calling, Mr. Deaton.
 Yes, sir--but when I make the call, my mother and I--we--
 I've made a business call--just to thank you and your mother, and to--
 No.
 Mr. Deaton--are you with Ms. St. Austell?
 Yes, sir.
 Do not you have something to tell me, Joe Deaton?
 Yes--but I won't know how to get him to talk about it, Joe.  I know this is a busy day for me, but the lady he's really been having a party with?--
 Joe Deaton, Joe Deaton told you something, Joe.
 Joe Deaton--do you mind?
 That's a great job.  Joe Deaton wants the job as soon as it's done.
 Can I come in, Joe?
 You're doing wonderful.  Thank you, Joe, Joe.
 Yes, sir--what do I look like, Joe?
 You said, Joe Deaton--in the newspaper.
 Yes, Joe--but Joe--why do you ask?
 I'm Joe Deaton, Joe Deaton.  I'm the one who's writing these headlines about it.
 You're what, Joe Deaton?  I don't mean what you look like, Joe.
 This could give us something to work for.
 Mr. Deaton.  I don't have any more time.
 Who are you?
 Joe--I don't want more time.  Mr. Delmonte, you have a job to do now, aren't you Joe Delmonte, Joe Deaton?
 Joe Deaton--can I ask you a question?
 It's Joe Deaton--
 Joe--what is it?
 Well, Mr. Deaton, if a child is under eighteen years old, then the state will punish the parents.
 Mr. Deaton, Mr. Deaton--
 I'm sorry, Mr. Deaton, I'm only a reporter, but--but I can assure you--the boy--the boy-- is an illegal alien, and we're going to make every effort to deport him.  We will prosecute him, the state will convict him, we are going to go to the county juvenile court, the county juvenile court is going to go to the county jail and we're going to go to the county juvenile jail.
 But Joe --
 Mr. Deaton, it's not the way I'm supposed to...
 Joe -- it sounds like you don't mean it...
 Please wait -- I want more time to think about it...
 I don't want to be late.
 You sure you don't want to go in?
 No.
 Come on, Joe--let's go in...You don't want to be late--I got a job to do.
 No -- I don't want to be late.
 What is it, Joe, why are you so damn late?
 No-- I got nothing.
 What are you going to do?
 I want to speak to Mr. Delmonte.
 Joe--this is Joe Deaton --this is Joe Delmonte.
 Joe?

 Hey, Joe -- what's your name?
 I want to talk to Mr. Deaton.
 Yeah, yeah, Joe -- oh!
 He's your partner.
 Well, my
