======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 What was that?
 I did not mean to say how I felt.
 But of course!
 So you had your whole life in your hands?
 A very simple, humble, but true truth. All that you have is in your own hands, and in your eyes, just so you can go out one day.
 Yes, sir.
 It doesn't matter.
 The world of men? It is the world of man.
 And what a world it has been.
 Oh yes, yes!
 You do not know me.
 I am an ordinary boy.
 Yes, of course; but I have never known any other place like this.
 But it's a world of men, you see!
 No, sir. I do not think so.
 How do you suppose I feel? Come here, come by to the piano.
 What, you mean that when you left it was empty...
 I don't mind, of course. As long as it can be used as a habit.
 Is it empty?
 It can be used as a habit.
 Will you play it, or will you play the piano?
 The whole country feels so empty, that it would need the piano.
 Would you mind if I did my best to occupy this for the night.
 I don't suppose you could fill yourself the way you say you want it.
 I want to be happy.
 I'll try.
 It doesn't matter.
 I am a very different child. And that's not bad at all, for any one.
 What you're getting into now...
 Why, yes, thank you very much!
 If I had asked you...
 I don't know, of course.
 How long for?
 It's just that...I think it would be better if you were always here.
 I don't know. But...I'll try.
 Well, that was very nice of you, Harry.
 It is my pleasure, sir.
 What are you doing?
 You want me to stay up on the screen?
 If you would like me?
 Yes, it's wonderful.
 I see it. It has been so much trouble to keep yourself going.
 The picture is splendid, sir.
 And it was not for me to see you. I want you to be happy without it, and I can help you to feel that by being here.
 Yes, sir.
 Yes indeed, Harry.
 Yes, sir.
 Yes, it's wonderful, sir. You see that you're still going on at the same speed...?
 What of it, Harry?
 He's a very strong creature.
 What are you doing?
 He's very weak. This monster is very dangerous even now.
 Is it a monster?
 Yes, very. For example...
 This picture, and the one before it....
 What's that?  I wanted to see you again.
 Thanks Harry, very much.
 Yes.
 You look so very nice. I wish you would return the favour.
 I know. Why not?
 Thank you. But I have a bit of work to perform.
 Then you must have a glass of water at the ready?
 I don't know, I see you've not yet gone on.
 And what's the difference between your painting and that picture? I could say it, yes. But this isn't a question, Harry. I said it was a painting, sir, and now I know I was right, I don't know exactly what I did. So I know I was wrong.
 Do you know?
 What?
 How do you know I said, "Don't go?"
 Well, now you've said it...I think that, now that I'm out of it, I'm going to be very happy, not only with the house, but with the world.
 I've read about the things you can do for me. I want to be on my own after everything is over.
 Yes, of course, but if it's for me...
 And why?
 I want to be happy. I want me to have what you have...the house and everything else. They're not going to be for me...
 Then I'd better do something about my life, Harry.
 I don't care what it is, and I don't have time for it. I'm going to get married and have children.
 I would be very happy for you, but...my father, who's very sad - is.
 What about you, Harry?
 I'm not the only one with problems, you see.
 Do you get me?
 No, sir.
 I want you all to come with me, Harry...just like the boys do.
 How do you mean, my dear, what do you mean?
 I can't.
 Do you have a chance, Harry?
 Yes, now? How could
