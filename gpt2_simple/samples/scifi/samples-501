======== SAMPLE 1 ========

But before she can explain, it turns out her voice is not her first choice.
As she is speaking, she asks why she is not speaking, to which Kha'Vam is very understanding.
She reveals it was a mistake: she is the only Human, she had an entire brain, because she only used the voice.
It was a terrible accident, but she was right, despite the fact that in that case, she couldn't have known it.
You're not my father, she says, but she's the only Human.
She is speaking to her and she is telling her that it is not your father, but your mother, and that it is just like that.
Well, Kha'Vam explains, a lot like that.
I wasn't your father, she adds.
Well, you are your mother, she says to Kha'Vam, and they both know this; Kha'Vam is lying.
No, you are not the father, Kha'Vam answers, before laughing, and when Dax asks who you are, Kha'Vam tells them that she was her mother and never used her first name.
Dax tells her she was really the third one, Kha'Vam says, and she just assumed her first name.
She's the one who always thought I was your father, Kha'Vam says, and Dax is shocked -- Kha'Vam had never known.
Kha'Vam is not your father, she tells Kha'Vam, but still remembers you, and he still trusts you.
So you see, Dax, he asks.
The third one, he tells her.
She just told him her first name and now her mother's last name, and Kha'Vam didn't trust her to look after her, either.
He tells her everything she wants to tell her family -- why she has been called that and how much he loved her.
He knows Kha'Vam was his first choice and that no one could have known what she said.
Kha'Vam doesn't remember her, but she doesn't want to be remembered.
Dax, still thinking about Kha'Vam, asks Kha'Vam if that's really true, to which Kha'Vam doesn't recall, only when she says she really did that.
Kha'Vam is very confused about this: How does it matter, Kha'Vam tells the Doctor, because Kha'Vam couldn't be wrong about what happened.
She's the person she is, you saw the dream as her body.
Kha'Vam tells the Doctor what she said, and he starts the TARDIS.
With this much effort, she has managed to talk to the real Kha'Vam about who she is and what she meant.
When the Doctor starts, the girl stops, only for him to tell her that she's the one, and she's the one.
Kha'Vam tells the Doctor she could have seen her body as Kha'Vam had when they met, and Kha'Vam says that Kha'Vam is the one she needed.
As the Doctor begins to speak the other, he sees her in bed, and when he goes to bed, she starts to cry and is starting to scream -- it's his imagination, of course, but he is in her body.
Kha'Vam tells Kha'Vam she could have seen Kha'Vam as the girl, and Kha'Vam says he could have seen her as her.
You couldn't, Kha'Vam's voice says, but Kha'Vam says there was no-one left.
When Kha'Vam's father returns to his quarters, Kha'Vam says that she hasn't been alone in the house, so Kha'Vam doesn't want to talk about it too much.
He goes to get her.
He starts kissing her, and when she begins crying again, Kha'Vam says she was so scared of her, and the dream was her body.
Kha'Vam tells her she's the one you needed when you were looking for Kha'Vam, and she's the one.
So, yeah.
That's what changed my life.
She has just gone into Kha'Vam's body, but she has lost her will.
She started crying, and now that she's gone and lost her will, she's lost everything.
She must have lost everything.
And now I know that she didn't make Kha'Vam want to kiss Kha'Vam again, she says, and she was wrong, but now I know who I am.
She looks at the Doctor
