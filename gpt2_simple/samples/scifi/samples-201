======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Taxana and the other Jem'Hadar from the Defiant who were captured.
They are being brought to her quarters in what appears to be a medical facility.
Kira insists this is not an appropriate location for the Jem'Hadar who are trying to get to her with the medical supplies.
Tek asks if that's what they're dealing with.
Kira states she doesn't know.
Kira tells him no.
O'Brien suggests that they have a procedure to save these trapped Jem'Hadar with.
Tek says no, but thanks.
Back on the USS Voyager, Neelix is working on the Defiant in her quarters.
He says the doctor would like it to be a Jem'Hadar colony, but would like nothing more than to stay a colony like theirs.
Tek says there's no one with a superior medical knowledge.
Neelix points out that the Jem'Hadar did not invade the Defiant; Neelix doesn't know if it was because she was wrong or if it was because she had found out about their history.
Neelix tells T'Pol that they are going to make a colony at her request.
Aboard of the USS Voyager, T'Pol is in sickbay with Kurn.
Kurn tells T'Pol that he needs a couple of days to relax and relax with him.
This is the first time he has tried it.
T'Pol asks him if he's ever had that kind of discomfort.
Kurn replies that he was just having the time to get better for the rest of the day.
After a few seconds, Kurn goes to sleep.
Meanwhile, Neelix is at Federation medical treatment.
She reports to an aide that she is having difficulty with her fingers as well.
Tek tells her that she can't understand why a disease is such a dangerous one.
Tek insists that she know it's a disease because it causes pain, and is not cured.
Kurn, O'Brien, and Neelix agree with their discussion.
In the Defiant, Kurn feels good enough to do so, but he is still struggling.
Kurn is also having difficulty maintaining control of the ship through a mechanical strain.
The Jem'Hadar are trying to extract some control rods that are being pulled out from a pod.
He has the rod dislodged -- but not by cutting through the pod.
He tells Neelix that they cannot control the ship and asks her to come with him.
She agrees but T'Pol insists that Voyager's sensors will be useful for detecting any anomalies.
The Jem'Hadar are working on the pod and Kurn notes when they are about to move it back, that the ship is in the Defiant, not the Defiant itself.
He asks Neelix if there's a way to save the Jem'Hadar, to which Neelix says no.
I mean, I've used my fingers as a tool.
Kurn reminds her that the Jem'Hadar are in no particular danger, that, in this situation, they've made the best choice right out of an interview.
Tek has a vision of the ship when the ship is ready to move and Kurn comments on the bridge.
Tek says that there's still a lot about the ship to consider, but that is very close to an optimal situation.
Kurn asks to be given the chance to think.
Tek says, Well then, if it is my idea to get back on the Defiant, why would I be so bad with all this -- just to make the Jem'Hadar look bad.
Kurn thanks him and walks out.
O'Brien and T'Pol, on the ship, discover that they haven't been able to use a tractor beam to escape the ship.
Neelix reports they are on the Defiant, and tries to get some energy off the defibrillator.
Neelix is in severe pain and is not aware of where the tractor beam will be when she begins to wake his ship.
The Jem'Hadar try to force the wormhole through.
Unfortunately, the defibrillator overloads and Kurn is forced to get out of the Defiant.
He runs out of control of the ship.
Neelix tells him the Jem'Hadar are all the same, but she does not believe that she would be like him.
Tek asks if he's going to run into trouble, but T'Pol says that it's probably not a possibility.
The Jem'Hadar attempt to bring the Defiant back but are hit in the face by a tractor beam -- the defibrillator.
Once back on the Defiant, T'Pol and the Jem'Hadar run into several Jem'Hadar who are on a collision course.
