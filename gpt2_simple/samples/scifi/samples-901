 their ship, but he soon realizes that the time has come to save Sisko and his crew.
He asks Sisko to stay with them, along with his companions on board.
Meanwhile, the USS Enterprise-D travels towards the Unknown Regions after an assault by the Dominion.
Captain Benjamin Sisko's first officer is the new commander, but as he is getting very close to the planet, Worf enters the captain's ready room and gives a speech, telling him, Welcome to the Starfury.
The captain tells Sisko that the Dominion forces are not hostile; the captain wishes to attack now.
Sisko accepts and then says goodbye to his two new crewmen, who come along later, along with Worf's young son, Aulus.
Sisko enters the captain's ready room, where he greets Sisko, who gives up the captain's ship's shields.
Sisko begins to apologize to the captain, but Worf is dismissive, making his apologies to Sisko a gesture of goodwill.
When Sisko tells the captain what the captain said, the captain quickly retorts, Oh, I'm sorry.
He tells Sisko they can't just go home, but that is what we're asking.
Sisko is relieved to have Worf back soon, as he had been a lot more caring than the captain.
Worf then leaves to make the Enterprise's rendezvous with the Enterprise.
Sisko is surprised that he will have Worf on board, to which the captain replies that he'll need him and his companions to stay here.
As a result, Sisko tells the crew that they'll need only one of them to take them aboard, and that they will be treated equally.
Upon their return to the Enterprise, Sisko asks for Worf, but he replies that they'll be treated as though they were dead, and can't do the same to him.
Worf tells Sisko the captain is right, saying that this is good.
Sisko agrees and walks away..

Data and Sisko are talking on a holodeck during a discussion on the way to a meeting at the Starbase Control Bureau.
One of the staff, an old lady named Nella, enters in a black suit, with a face full of her first name, first name, last name, and a holographic image of Sisko's first date with his first wife, Laeta, on a beach vacation in Arizona earlier.
She seems somewhat amused at what she does there as the only person there.
At that moment, the computer begins recording the program of the meeting.
The character, Phylis, enters the conference room as Nella and Nellie discuss a holographic recreation of a past occasion.
However, it is clear that Sisko wanted to make sure the program could be modified to better display an earlier occasion as well.
She asks Nellie to show him his last hologram of him before he died, and tells him to remember his last hologram of him earlier on a small planet in one of the many planets Sisko visited.
Nellie replies that he was killed by an asteroid, while Sisko was on his way out of Earth as a civilian for a ship to attack a hostile species.
When Nellie tells him that the program was modified to get him into a simulation, Sisko takes a moment then says, You remember that day.
Nellie and Sisko discuss the program in the holodeck.
After the simulation is over, Nella and Nella go to another holodeck to observe the holographic presentation of a discussion between Sisko and Thanasa during Quark's birthday party.
Upon returning to the holodeck, Quark's guests go over to him, as they had no control over their time.
After Nella and Ensign Pulaski go over to him, but not before she asks Sisko what his favorite thing to do is.
In a turbolift, Nella calls Sisko and walks over to him.
Sisko tells her to get ready and leave, before leaving.
Nella then asks Sisko to leave, before walking over to him and kissing him.
As she walks, Sisko is suddenly startled to see she is still alive.
She then asks what Sisko is talking about.
As she walks away, Sisko walks down the corridor, having forgotten his last hologram of him.
Nella greets Sisko, asking how long he was in the Starfury.
Sisko says it was one of the few times he had a chance to be alone.
Nellie is not surprised by this, claiming that it was a gift for her to remember.
She says she felt like
