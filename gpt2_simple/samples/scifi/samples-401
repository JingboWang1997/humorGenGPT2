 is like this since he is only a pilot, not Captain Archer.
Archer believes Archer will tell Archer that if they had him now, he would have told the other crew he would be returning back if there was a change of direction.
They discuss the changes and Archer leaves the room and enters the transporter room where Quark is talking to Archer.
Once he leaves the transporter room, Quark asks if she is in love with them, which she reveals that she is not.
Quark then goes in and asks for a list of names he will remember and gives him one that only Quark can remember.
Then, Quark is gone and Quark says he will take the list with him, as he is tired.
Archer then leaves, as he is now alone.
The rest of the team then takes the T-35's to Quark, who tells them that the Doctor has contacted him and asked that they take a look at his medical file.
On the T-35, the pilot's scan revealed a large, irregular region where the arm bones were.
He went under the arm to investigate and he found that he had been transported back to Earth from the original world.
Archer points out that there is no evidence of other humans being transported back and Archer replies that there were other humans in the original world.
However, since the T-35 is a large ship, the transport has to be completed by the time Archer and his crew reach the Tachyon core as it was supposed to.
The ship then leaves the core and the shuttlebay shuts down, the shuttle is now completely occupied.
Archer later goes through Quark's medical file and finds information about the Doctor and his Tachyon readings.
There is a scan that shows a blood clot that was present at the time the Doctor was transported back.
Archer explains that the doctors only told Archer they found the Doctor's blood in the shuttle bay but he was never sent back.
The doctor then says that it is hard to tell where the blood clot was, but says it is in a way that doesn't look like a blood clot.
He continues saying the clot is located in the shuttlebay, but the shuttle stops in the same place before it can contact Earth.
In the shuttlebay, Archer is talking to Quark when he walks in through the door and Archer says that Quark is the captain.
He then points out that Quark has the name of Captain Archer in the file and that he must tell him he is Captain Archer.
Archer then asks Quark where he is from to do research out of the station.
Quark tells him that he was born in Babylon 5.
The Doctor then explains that he did not have a Starfleet command, but the captain wanted him to know how to perform his duties and ask for permission to return home to his ship before doing so..

The USS Defiant is attacked due to a disturbance aboard the Defiant.
Captain Kathryn Janeway is sent down to the planet to recover some supplies, but instead of her, she is attacked by some pirates.
Later, as Janeway has the Defiant down, they find another ship in danger--this time, this time the Defiant.
When Janeway arrives back on the planet, she immediately encounters the same pirates.
Janeway is then attacked by several of them.
As Janeway is sent to the Defiant's engineering, the captain states that he did not know how to disable the shields while in the Defiant; Janeway then says she did it because there was nothing she could do from there.
Janeway insists that she did in fact do it but Janeway tells Janeway that she was able to do more with her time on the planet and it was still dangerous.
Just as they return from the planet, Janeway says, they learn that they can use the warp engines to access the Defiant's systems.
They manage to disable the sensors and escape.
After Janeway gives them the coordinates for the Defiant, she says they can then board the ship, which Janeway then asks for the captain's orders.
In engineering, a crew member notices a black-out on the console.
Janeway and Janes discuss this and Janeway then notices that Janes, in sickbay, has a headache over the noise the sound from the ship's weapons is from.
Janes then notices that on both sides there are two blackouts on each side..

Dax has received no response from Sato and Lieutenant Commander Chakotay.
Sato also goes to find him and finds Chakotay having a conversation on the bridge of the USS Voyager.
After getting to their rendezvous point with their shuttlecraft, Sato is brought aboard by one of the crewmembers as they are boarding his shuttle.
As they board, they start to run into some issues and Sato tells
