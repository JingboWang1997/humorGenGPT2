 of Sari to help them in a way that is not a slave to the TARDIS, thus avoiding capture by aliens.
When the Doctor is not there to rescue Sari the TARDIS is on the bridge, where it is seen by the Doctor as his TARDIS.
There is some difficulty in getting the Doctor to tell someone of the situation at the TARDIS, so they decide to escape the TARDIS.
The Doctor is initially seen in the TARDIS by the TARDIS driver, who runs away in a car, and the travellers escape towards the nearby village through a large gate before being discovered by the police.
The Doctor is taken to the prison, where he fights with a security guard as Sari tries to get out.
He is confronted by the guards and Sari, who is still alive, says Sari told them that Sari was his wife.
They try to save Tari but are attacked by aliens.
The TARDIS explodes on contact by the guards, and the Doctor is sent back to the prison.
The Doctor and Sari escape into the TARDIS, where the Doctor and the others escape as the guards try to save them.
On entering the hospital, the Doctor realises that the others aren't there, and that the TARDIS is the one person who can save them.
The TARDIS is quickly transported and freed from destruction.
All of Sari's family, friends, and colleagues have escaped at the hospital, all of Sari's friends having been arrested.
The Doctor and Sari leave the hospital where there is a massive explosion, and the TARDIS and the guards quickly destroy the area.
Unfortunately, the Doctor and Sari all die, as the TARDIS is damaged by the explosion.
However, the TARDIS is recovered by the guards soon after, and Sari, a reluctant witness to another case, becomes a witness.
The Doctor and Sari are able to access the TARDIS, but the guards aren't able to unlock the controls.
The Doctor and Sari, who are trying to talk to Sari as she is being rescued, find a secret entrance for the TARDIS, revealing the doors to the TARDIS and the outside world to be a prison.
The Doctor and Sari escape with the TARDIS, escape from their imprisonment and escape from death.
Sari, who has been kept prisoner, is brought out of a vision and is saved by the Doctor.
As he has been released, the prison opens and Sari is imprisoned, only to be brought forward after being released from the TARDIS, who is being held against her will.
However, the prisoner, Radek, refuses to be released and escapes.
The Doctor and Sari are sent to the TARDIS by the guards.
When Sari and the Master manage to escape, the guards arrest Sari and are able to interrogate her.
However, this does not matter as the Master is released.
With nothing to do, Sari is released.
In this predicament, the Doctor and Sari try to find the TARDIS.
When the Doctor and Sari find nothing they are able to use the TARDIS to make a way for the TARDIS back into the prison.
The only way to get the control back is to go back to the TARDIS.
While the Doctor and Sari are in the TARDIS, the Doctor and Sari are able to get out of the TARDIS.
In the TARDIS, the Doctor and Sari are able to open a new door into the cell which Sari is in.
The Doctor realizes that there are two more doors in the cell, one which Sari will enter with and one which Sari will not.
The Doctor and Sari reach the cell and enter the cell.
When they walk through the cell Sari sees Sari standing over her, telling her to go to a place of comfort.
Sari's mind is completely blank and she cannot communicate.
The Doctor and Sari discover a room where the Master was imprisoned and then discover the Master being released.
The Doctor and Sari escape the cell.
The Master is now free, but the Doctor has come a long way.
Sari is freed from Sari's mental control.
As a result the Doctor is able to communicate with Sari.
The Master has taken control of Sari.
The Doctor and Sari successfully escape through the door, in the TARDIS.
In the TARDIS this process is very successful; the Doctor and Sari escape into the cell.
When the Master arrives in the cell where the Master was imprisoned, however, Sari and Sari are still in the cell.
Sari is allowed to go through the Master's mind.
The Doctor opens the door to leave Sari and Sari, who are in the cell with the Master.
Suddenly, the Master appears and reveals himself to be trapped.
