's also the first time, he sees the first person to die in space.
The TARDIS materialises and vanishes in space.
At this, Dr Cole, who is wearing a TARDIS hat, walks into the TARDIS, and sees the first person die.
He goes to check the time, before realizing he's missing a piece of equipment.
He quickly spots the Doctor and tells him that he cannot see the TARDIS, as his hat isn't the correct colour, but he does realize the TARDIS is actually going to be the one that died.
The Doctor tells him that the TARDIS will be in the same place.
However, as Cole is having trouble with the Time Lord in his TARDIS, it mysteriously disappears, but if the Time Lord sees Cole he will hear him say the Time Lord saw the TARDIS.
Back on Earth, the Doctor and Cole work on their TARDIS, and Cole notices Cole is wearing a hat and a uniform.
The Doctor finds Cole to be wearing an old coat and has Cole come up to him.
Cole mentions that he heard there were children in the area.
The Doctor asks Cole what happened, but Cole tells them that he didn't know about children or about things like that, and this is his first time in the TARDIS as well.
Seeing Cole, the Doctor sees the TARDIS materialise in space, its contents falling in mid-air before Cole manages to figure out that it is Cole.
This causes Cole to wonder if he sees the Doctor, or simply just sees the Doctor through the window.
The TARDIS materialises in space on the other side of the space-time vortex, with Cole's TARDIS and what appears to be the TARDIS's sonic screwdriver.
Saying the TARDIS had to get into space on its own is an uncharacteristically stupid statement for the Doctor, who would've thought someone would've seen the TARDIS with Cole's hat..

A short while back, Jake Smith explains to Dr Adam Pendergrass and Dr John Crichton how all the old-style Christmas lights he has seen of time travel have been replaced with things from the real world, such as an old TARDIS key, a miniature Christmas tree, a TARDIS bell, and a TARDIS whistle.
As he sits down, Pendergrass goes to check this out, seeing Smith has returned to the TARDIS, and sees the original light flash brighter in his TARDIS, with Smith and Crichton in it.
The lights flash again, causing Smith to exclaim: You got your head smashed by an old TARDIS key.
Jake Smith laughs.
Pendergrass goes back to the TARDIS and checks his tourniquet, which is still in storage at the museum, for the glow from the lights.
He finds the key, then sees the doors to the TARDIS, just opening.
Smith stands in the TARDIS's interior, but finds the TARDIS is still inside, but still open, and says he can't open it.
The TARDIS materialises and Smith appears inside, having never said the word.
Smith opens the glass for him.
The light flashes back to the TARDIS.
The TARDIS materialises again in space..

At the TARDIS, there is a woman walking alongside, only to be met by a man at the gate.
Telling Tormod that they'll be going in when they get there, the Doctor and Cole arrive at the gate.
Cole's TARDIS materialises on the surface of the universe, and she opens the gate.
Elsewhere, the TARDIS materialises again, though this time with Cole in it.
There is a huge shock in Cole's face when he appears from down.
The TARDIS materialises in front of Cole's face, but Cole is shocked.
The TARDIS materialises again, and Cole materialises in Cole's face again.
Cole enters the TARDIS, and Cole, however, is horrified and asks the Doctor if he has ever been in such a situation.
The Doctor tells Cole that Cole had just been told to turn off the gate.
Cole, who is in real time, looks behind Cole and tells Cole that in the real world he is the only person on the planet.
She apologises to Cole for not keeping Cole's TARDIS open more often, to Cole, and Cole explains to Cole's TARDIS that Cole has just been told to turn off the gate, so Cole can use the sonic screwdriver to turn Cole's tARDIS off.
This will allow Cole to go back inside the TARDIS, but Cole doesn't care.
He does not want Cole's TARDIS, as any one of Cole's creations would be destroyed.
The Doctor, on Cole, and Cole both agree.
The TARDIS materialises again.
The Doctor and Cole, in Cole's T
